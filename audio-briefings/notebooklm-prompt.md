This briefing is for Aidan, who runs a leisure venue (bowling, go-karting, escape rooms) and has recently been diagnosed with ADHD. He's a friend of Tony's, not a corporate client, so keep the tone warm and conversational.

**Key points to emphasise:**

1. **Start with the ADHD angle** - Explain that the recommendations are specifically designed around how his brain works. The capture tools (Wispr Flow, Granola) come FIRST because they address his core challenge: too many ideas, not enough getting captured.

2. **Make it practical, not technical** - Aidan doesn't need to understand how these tools work under the hood. Focus on what they DO for him and why that matters.

3. **Voice-to-text is the game-changer** - Spend time on Wispr Flow. The idea that he can speak instead of type, anywhere on his computer, is transformative for someone whose brain moves faster than their fingers.

4. **Granola captures meetings automatically** - No more "what did we decide?" moments. The AI takes notes so he doesn't have to.

5. **Low monthly cost** - Make clear this isn't expensive. Around £56/month for everything, which is less than one bowling party brings in.

6. **Tony will do the technical setup** - Aidan doesn't need to configure anything. Tony will install the tools and show him how to use them.

7. **Website stuff is secondary** - Mention the website recommendations briefly, but the personal productivity tools are the priority.

8. **End with encouragement** - This isn't about fixing something broken. It's about giving his brain the support system it needs to work the way it naturally wants to.

**Tone guidance:**
- Two friends explaining something helpful, not salespeople pitching
- Acknowledge that ADHD is challenging without being patronising
- Use concrete examples (dictating an email, capturing a phone call)
- Keep it under 10 minutes if possible

# Marketing Opportunities Rogue Leisure Is Missing

## Who This Is For

This briefing is for Aidan Kirwan, owner of Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Aidan runs a 40,000 square foot leisure venue with bowling, go-karting, and an escape room. His friend Tony Winyard, who works in AI and automation consulting, put this together after visiting the venue.

Aidan has ADHD, so Tony has formatted this as a NotebookLM audio source. Stick it on while you're driving to Liverpool. No need to read anything. Just listen.

This isn't a formal marketing plan. It's a conversation about what's working, what's being missed, and what could make a real difference without costing a fortune.

## What You're Already Doing Right

Before getting into what's missing, it's worth saying something clearly: Rogue Leisure's marketing is not broken. There are some genuinely strong foundations here.

**8,800 Facebook followers.** For a local leisure venue in a town the size of Aylesbury, that's a serious audience. Most independent leisure businesses would kill for that number. That's not a vanity metric. That's 8,800 people who chose to follow you, which means they're interested in what you do. They're either past customers, future customers, or people who'll recommend you to someone else. That audience has real value.

**The authentic content strategy is already working.** Aidan, you instinctively know what gets people engaged, and it's not the polished Canva graphics. It's real people and real stories. The post about the 87-year-old lady doing go-karting? Massive engagement. The granddaughter bowling? Same thing. Those posts work because they're genuine. People see themselves in those stories. They think "that could be my nan" or "that could be my kid." That emotional connection is worth more than any amount of stock photography or cartoon graphics.

This is important because a lot of what follows in this briefing is about doing more of what already works, not reinventing the wheel.

**Gift cards on the website.** These recently launched, and that's a smart move. Gift cards are pure revenue. Someone buys a gift card and it sits in a drawer for months. Sometimes it never gets redeemed. Even when it does, the recipient often spends more than the card value when they visit. It's also a gateway: someone who's never been to Rogue receives a gift card, comes in, has a good time, and now they're a customer who comes back on their own.

**Aidan is personally active on social media.** This matters more than people think. Customers connect with people, not logos. When Aidan posts something or replies to a comment, that's a real person behind the business. It builds trust and loyalty in a way that a corporate social media account never can.

So. Good foundations. Now let's talk about what's being left on the table.

## Social Media: The Low-Hanging Fruit

### Instagram Is Hugely Underused

952 Instagram followers versus 8,800 on Facebook. That's a massive gap, and it represents a missed opportunity.

During the visit, Tony walked Aidan through connecting Instagram to Meta Business Suite. Once that's done (and it only takes a few minutes), every post can go to Facebook AND Instagram at the same time. No extra work. Same content, double the reach.

But here's why Instagram specifically matters for Rogue. Instagram is a visual platform. And Rogue Leisure is an incredibly visual business. The karting track with its dual-level layout and banked corner. The bowling lanes lit up in the evening. Groups celebrating after an escape room. Kids' faces when they get behind the wheel of a kart. This content practically makes itself.

Right now, all of that visual potential is only reaching the Facebook audience. The Instagram audience, which skews younger and is highly active locally, is barely being touched.

### Short-Form Video Is the Biggest Opportunity

Reels and short-form video consistently get two to three times more reach than static images on both Facebook and Instagram. The algorithms actively push video content to new audiences. A static image might reach your existing followers. A Reel can reach people who've never heard of Rogue.

The types of video that work brilliantly for a venue like Rogue:

- 15-second clip of a kart going round the banked corner (film it from the barrier, phone is fine)
- Kids celebrating a strike on the bowling lanes
- A group's reaction when they escape the room with seconds to spare
- Time-lapse of a birthday party setup
- A quick walkthrough of the venue showing all three activities

None of this requires professional equipment. A phone is all you need. The marketing person can film a few clips in an afternoon and have a week's worth of content.

### User-Generated Content

Encourage customers to tag @rogueleisure when they post about their visit. Then repost their content (with permission, though most people are thrilled to be featured). This is free content that's completely authentic. It also builds a sense of community. People want to be part of something.

A simple sign at the venue, something like "Had fun? Tag us @rogueleisure on Instagram," costs almost nothing and generates content on autopilot.

### TikTok

If there's appetite for one more platform, TikTok is the natural fit. The karting track is perfect TikTok content. POV footage from a kart, time-lapse of a race, kids' reactions, behind-the-scenes of setting up the track. The 13-to-17 age group practically lives on TikTok, and this demographic is underserved in Aylesbury for entertainment options.

This doesn't have to happen now. But when the Instagram rhythm is established and the short-form video muscle is built, TikTok is the obvious next step. The same content works on both platforms.

## The Review Problem (and Opportunity)

Rogue has 4.5+ stars on Google and strong reviews on TripAdvisor. Customers say brilliant things about the staff, the track, the atmosphere. This is genuinely valuable.

But there's no system for asking for reviews. It's all happening organically, which means it's happening slowly. And it means you're only hearing from the people who are motivated enough to leave a review unprompted, which is always a small percentage.

### Post-Visit Review Automation

The fix is simple. Send a message (email or text) two to four hours after a visit. Something like: "Had fun at Rogue today? We'd love a quick Google review!" with a direct link that takes them straight to the review form. No hunting around, no friction.

Two to four hours is the sweet spot. They've had time to get home and settle, but the experience is still fresh. Send it the next day and they've moved on.

Tools like Podium can automate this, but even a basic email automation would work. We're talking under 20 quid a month, possibly free depending on what tools you already use. And more Google reviews means better Google ranking, which means more people find Rogue when they search for things like "go karting Aylesbury" or "bowling near me."

### Reviews on the Website

This is the biggest quick win in this entire document. None of those Google and TripAdvisor reviews appear on the Rogue Leisure website.

Think about that. Someone lands on your website, they're considering booking. They have no idea that hundreds of other people have been and loved it. All that social proof, all those positive experiences, completely invisible.

Pick the five or ten best quotes. Real customers saying real things. "Best karting track we've been to." "The staff were amazing with the kids." "Perfect birthday party venue." Add them to the homepage and to each activity page.

Jane can do this in Webflow in a couple of hours. The impact on booking confidence is immediate.

## The Missing FAQ Page

People search Google with questions. Specific, practical questions like:

- "What to wear go karting Aylesbury"
- "Parking at Rogue Leisure"
- "Rogue Leisure age restrictions karting"
- "Can kids do go karting Aylesbury"
- "How long is a bowling session at Rogue"
- "Do I need to book escape room Aylesbury"

Right now, these questions aren't answered anywhere obvious on the website. Every unanswered question has one of two outcomes. Either the person picks up the phone and calls, which costs staff time. Or they give up and book somewhere else, which costs revenue.

An FAQ page solves both problems. It costs nothing to create. Jane can build it in Webflow in an afternoon. Cover the obvious questions for each activity: what to wear, where to park, age and height restrictions, arrival times, cancellation policy, group sizes, pricing clarifications.

There's an SEO bonus too. Google loves question-and-answer content. When someone types "what to wear go karting Aylesbury" into Google, a page that directly answers that question has a strong chance of appearing in the search results. That's a new visitor who might not have heard of Rogue otherwise.

And here's a practical benefit for later: once all those questions and answers are written down, they become the knowledge base for a chatbot if you ever want one on the website. The hard work (figuring out what people ask and writing good answers) is already done.

## Corporate Marketing: Money Left on the Table

This is the section where the numbers get interesting.

Right now, there's no corporate landing page on the Rogue website. Companies searching for "team building Aylesbury" or "corporate events Buckinghamshire" can't find Rogue. That search traffic is going to competitors or to venues in other towns.

### Why Corporate Matters

A corporate booking is high-value. A company bringing 20 people for a team day will spend five to ten times what a family of four spends. And corporate bookings repeat. The same company comes back for their Christmas party, their summer event, their new starter induction day. Once you're in their rotation, that revenue comes back year after year with minimal marketing effort.

The hybrid working trend has actually made this more valuable, not less. Companies with distributed teams are actively looking for in-person experiences that bring people together. Go-karting, bowling, and an escape room are exactly the kind of thing HR teams book for team-building days.

Here's a stat worth knowing: nationally, roughly 19% of escape room bookings are corporate. If Rogue could capture even a fraction of the local corporate demand with a proper landing page and enquiry process, it would meaningfully move the revenue needle.

### What's Needed

A dedicated page on the website that speaks directly to corporate bookers. This is a different audience to families and birthday parties. They want to know:

- What corporate packages are available (can they combine karting, bowling, and the escape room?)
- Typical group sizes you can accommodate
- What a corporate day actually looks like, from arrival to finish
- How to get a quote
- Whether there's a separate space for a briefing or debrief
- Catering options (even if it's just "we can arrange food, ask us")

Add testimonials from any companies who've held events there. Even one or two quotes from a corporate customer would make a difference.

And a simple enquiry form. Name, company, number of people, preferred date, what activities they're interested in. That's it. Keep it short. The conversation happens after they've made contact.

---

## Email Marketing: The Untapped Channel

This might be the most overlooked opportunity of all.

Every customer who books through any of Rogue's three booking systems (QubicaAMF Conqueror X for bowling, Book My Karting for go-karting, Resova for the escape room) has given their email address. That's a goldmine of contacts. People who have already visited, already had a good time, and are the most likely people to come back.

The question is: is anyone doing anything with those email addresses?

### A Monthly Newsletter

It doesn't need to be fancy. A simple monthly email that keeps Rogue top of mind. What's happening this month, any special offers, new activities or changes, a behind-the-scenes photo or story. Keep it short, keep it casual, and always include a booking link.

People are busy. They had a great time at Rogue three months ago, but they've forgotten about it. A friendly email that lands in their inbox on the first of the month reminds them you exist. "Oh yeah, we should do that again."

Tools like Mailchimp have free tiers that would cover this for a long time.

### Birthday Reminder Automation

This one is clever, and it runs on autopilot once it's set up.

When someone books a kids' birthday party or enquires about one, capture the child's birthday date. Six weeks before that date, send an automated email: "It's nearly [child's name]'s birthday! Book a party at Rogue and get 10% off if you book this week."

Parents start thinking about birthday parties roughly four to six weeks out. If Rogue is the first option that lands in their inbox at exactly the right time, with a small incentive attached, the conversion rate will be strong.

This is repeat revenue on autopilot. Set it up once, and it runs every year.

### Event Reminder Automation

Same principle, applied to corporate bookings. A company that booked their Christmas party at Rogue in December 2025 gets a friendly nudge in October 2026: "Time to start planning this year's Christmas do? We'd love to have your team back."

The person who organised last year's event probably hasn't started thinking about this year's yet. Being first in their inbox, with a warm reminder of a good experience, puts Rogue at the top of the list before they even start looking at alternatives.

## Seasonal Marketing Opportunities

Leisure businesses are seasonal. Demand shifts throughout the year, and smart marketing anticipates those shifts rather than reacting to them.

Here's a rough calendar of opportunities:

**February half-term (coming up soon).** Family packages and multi-activity deals. "Book bowling and karting together and save." Half-term is when parents are desperate for things to do with the kids. Be visible before it starts, not during it.

**Easter holidays.** Same approach. Family bundles, group deals.

**Summer.** Corporate team days (companies often do summer team-building), kids' activity sessions, holiday clubs if there's capacity. Summer is also when the weather makes outdoor alternatives more attractive, so indoor activities need to shout a bit louder.

**September and October.** This is when corporate Christmas party bookings start. Companies plan early, especially the bigger ones. An email or social media push in September saying "Christmas party dates are filling up" creates urgency.

**November and December.** Gift card push. This is the perfect time because people are looking for presents. Gift cards solve the "what do I get someone who has everything" problem. Push these hard on social media and email from early November.

**January.** New Year deals to fill the quiet period. "Start the year with something fun." This is also a good time to launch or promote a loyalty scheme.

The content calendar doesn't have to be complicated. One post per day, planned a week ahead. The marketing person can batch-create content. Spend a couple of hours on Monday planning and creating the week's posts, then schedule them. Done.

## Partnerships and Cross-Promotion

This is about making Rogue part of the local ecosystem rather than operating in isolation. Every partnership means access to someone else's audience for free.

### Local Restaurants

"Dinner and bowling" packages. Rogue provides the entertainment, a local restaurant provides the meal. Both businesses promote the package to their own audiences. The restaurant's customers discover Rogue. Rogue's customers discover the restaurant. Everyone wins.

This works particularly well for date nights and group outings. "Friday night out in Aylesbury: bowling at Rogue, then dinner at [partner restaurant]."

### Hotels

Aylesbury has hotels that host guests visiting for weddings, events, or business. Those guests often ask reception "what is there to do around here?" If Rogue has a presence at the front desk (a leaflet, a recommendation card, a small commission arrangement), that's a steady trickle of visitors who might never have found you otherwise.

### Schools

Term-time weekdays are typically the quietest period for leisure venues. Schools represent a way to fill that gap. End-of-term reward trips, sports day alternatives, STEM-through-karting framing (physics of racing, teamwork, problem-solving with the escape room). Schools are always looking for trip destinations, and a venue with three different activities is a strong option.

### The Local Party Ecosystem

Birthday parties are a significant revenue stream for Rogue. The parents booking those parties are also booking photographers, cake makers, entertainers, and party suppliers. Building relationships with those businesses creates referral loops. The photographer recommends Rogue as a great party venue. Rogue recommends the photographer to party-booking parents. Both get more business.

## What About the Marketing Person?

Aidan has a part-time marketing person who uses Canva and ChatGPT. That's a decent starting point, but the role could be more effective with some focus.

The move away from cartoony Canva graphics toward authentic content is the right instinct. The data backs it up: real photos and real stories outperform designed graphics every time for a local leisure business. People scrolling Facebook don't stop for a cartoon bowling pin. They stop for a kid celebrating a strike.

The marketing person's time is probably best spent on:

1. **Filming short video clips at the venue** (15-30 seconds, phone is fine)
2. **Capturing customer stories** (with permission) to turn into social posts
3. **Managing the review request process** once it's set up
4. **Planning content a week ahead** rather than scrambling for ideas day-to-day
5. **Monitoring what performs well** and doing more of it

ChatGPT is useful for drafting captions and email copy. Canva still has a role for things like event posters and story templates. But the core content strategy should be: real people, real moments, short videos, and authentic stories.

## Three Things to Start This Week

The full list above is a lot to take in. So here are three things that can happen immediately, this week, with minimal effort.

**1. Connect Instagram to Meta Business Suite.** Tony showed you how during the visit. It takes a few minutes. Once it's done, every Facebook post also goes to Instagram. Instant doubling of distribution for zero extra work.

**2. Pick five of the best Google reviews and send them to Jane.** Ask her to add them to the homepage and the main activity pages. This takes her a couple of hours in Webflow. The impact on visitor confidence is immediate. Real customers, real words, visible where new visitors can see them.

**3. Set up a simple post-visit review request.** Even before automating this with software, you can start with a printed card. A small card handed out at reception or placed near the exit: "Had fun today? We'd love a Google review!" with a QR code that links directly to your Google Reviews page. Print 500 for under a tenner. It's not fancy, but it works.

These three things cost almost nothing, take very little time, and each one will produce visible results within weeks.

---

## The Bigger Picture

Rogue Leisure has a strong product. People who visit generally love it. The reviews prove that. Aidan's instinct for authentic content proves that. The 8,800 Facebook followers prove that.

What's missing isn't a complete marketing overhaul. It's the systems and channels that turn those happy customers into repeat visitors, new customers, and advocates. Reviews that are visible. Content that reaches new audiences. Email that keeps people coming back. A website that answers questions and serves corporate bookers as well as families.

None of this requires a huge budget. Most of it requires time and consistency more than money. And with a part-time marketing person already in place, the capacity is there. It just needs direction.

Start with the three things this week. Build from there. Each piece makes the next one easier.

## About This Document

This briefing was prepared by Tony Winyard of Winyard AI and Automation, based on a venue visit, discovery conversations with Aidan, and an analysis of Rogue Leisure's current online presence.

It's intended as a NotebookLM audio source so Aidan can listen to it rather than read it. The conversational tone is deliberate.

## Custom Prompt for Audio Generation

This briefing is for Aidan, who owns Rogue Leisure (bowling, go-karting, escape rooms in Aylesbury). He's a friend of Tony's who's been helping him with AI and automation. This audio focuses specifically on website improvements.

**Key points to emphasise:**

1. **Start positive** - The website isn't broken. It works. But it's leaving opportunities on the table.

2. **The big miss is social proof** - Aidan has great reviews on Google and TripAdvisor, but none of them appear on his website. This is the single biggest quick win.

3. **Show, don't just tell** - The dual-level track with the banked corner is genuinely special. Competitors don't have it. But there are no photos of it on the site. Visitors can't see what makes Rogue different.

4. **The escape room page needs work** - It's missing basic information. People have to click through to another site just to find out the price and how many people can play.

5. **FAQ saves phone calls** - Every question the website doesn't answer becomes a phone call or a lost booking. Simple stuff like "what should I wear?" and "where do I park?"

6. **Corporate bookings are untapped** - There's no dedicated page for companies organising team events. That's money being left on the table.

7. **The site is built on Webflow** - This is actually good news. It means changes can be made without hiring developers. The question is whether Aidan has access or if an agency controls it.

8. **Keep the reliability point** - Mention that website improvements bring people in, but equipment reliability (karts breaking down, bowling lanes having issues) is what keeps them coming back. Don't dwell on it, but it's worth noting.

9. **End with practical next steps** - Check Webflow access, gather photos, collect testimonials. Small, doable actions.

**Tone guidance:**
- Practical and encouraging, not critical
- This is a friend pointing out opportunities, not a consultant delivering bad news
- Use specific examples (the banked corner, the Crazy Cat Lady escape room)
- Avoid jargon - explain things in plain English
- Keep it under 8-10 minutes

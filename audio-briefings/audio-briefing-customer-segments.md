# Customer Segments and Ideal Customer Profiles for Rogue Leisure

## Who This Is For

This briefing is for Aidan Kirwan, owner of Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury. Aidan runs a 40,000 square foot multi-activity leisure venue with bowling, go-karting, an escape room, karaoke, an arcade, and a bar. Breakeven is 80 thousand pounds a month. The team is 29 people, 22 of them on zero-hour contracts. The venue is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Revenue splits roughly 70% bowling, 25% karting, and 5% escape room.

Tony Winyard, Aidan's friend and AI consultant, put this together to help Aidan think about the different types of customer walking through the door, and what to do about each one.

## Why Thinking About Customer Segments Matters

Not everyone who walks through the door at Rogue wants the same thing. That sounds obvious. But it's worth sitting with for a second, because most leisure venues market to "everyone" with the same message, the same prices, and the same page on the website. And then they wonder why certain slots sit empty while Friday night is rammed.

A family with three kids under ten wants something completely different from a corporate team of twenty-five. A group of teenagers on a Saturday night wants something different from a retired couple on a Wednesday morning. A hen party organiser is solving a completely different problem than a school trip coordinator.

When you understand this, three things become possible.

First, you can market to each group differently. Instead of one generic Facebook post saying "Come bowling at Rogue," you can run targeted messages that speak directly to what each group actually cares about. The family cares about convenience and value. The corporate booker cares about looking good in front of their team. The hen party organiser cares about having a fun afternoon sorted without stress.

Second, you can build packages that match what each group wants to buy. Right now, Rogue has a relatively flat offering. Everyone gets roughly the same menu of options. But a corporate group would pay more for a bespoke package with catering. A stag party would pay more for a tiered experience with drinks included. A school group needs a completely different proposition with educational framing and risk assessments.

Third, and this is the big one, you can fill the venue during the quiet times. If bowling is 70% of revenue and most of that comes on weekends from families, that means there are lanes sitting empty on Wednesday mornings, Thursday afternoons, and every Monday and Tuesday. Different customer segments use the venue at different times. Seniors bowl on weekday mornings. Corporates book midweek. Schools come during term-time weekdays. Targeting those groups specifically is how you turn dead time into revenue without spending a penny more on the building.

This isn't theory from a business textbook. It's about making more money from the same 40,000 square feet you're already paying rent on.

Let's go through each segment.

---

## Segment 1: Families (Your Bread and Butter)

This is where most of the money comes from right now, and that makes sense. Aylesbury is a family town. The core family customer is parents aged 30 to 45 with children aged 5 to 15. They're looking for something to do on a Saturday afternoon, or they need to book a birthday party, or they want a half-term activity that doesn't involve driving to Milton Keynes.

What families value is fairly predictable, but worth spelling out because it shapes everything from pricing to website copy.

**Convenience.** They don't want to drive 45 minutes to Xscape MK. They want something local that's easy to get to, has parking, and doesn't eat up half the day in travel. Rogue wins here by default. You're the only multi-activity venue in Aylesbury.

**Value for money.** This is a price-sensitive group. Research shows 29% of families actively seek leisure discounts before booking. They compare. They look for offers. They check if there's a deal on Groupon or a family bundle. If two places offer bowling and one has a "family of four" deal, they'll pick the deal every time.

**Multiple activities in one place.** This is Rogue's single biggest advantage for families. A parent can book bowling for the kids, let the teenagers have a go on the karts, and grab a drink at the bar while they wait. Nobody else in Aylesbury offers that combination. Flip Out has variety, but it skews younger and doesn't have bowling or karting.

**Easy party packages.** Birthday parties are a massive revenue driver for family leisure venues. Every parent of a child aged 5 to 12 will, at some point, need to book a party venue. The question is whether Rogue makes that process so easy the parent doesn't even consider alternatives.

**Safety.** Parents need to feel confident their children are safe, particularly on the go-kart track. The good news is that Rogue's reviews consistently mention how good the marshals are with kids. That reputation is valuable.

### The Competition for Family Spend

Families in Aylesbury have choices. **Flip Out** is the big local competitor, starting from 5.50 per person with ice skating, mini golf, laser quest, soft play, and more. For families with children under eight, Flip Out is probably the first choice. **Hollywood Bowl in MK** has VIP lanes, a full food menu, and a polished experience, but it's a 30-to-45-minute drive. **Gravity Active in MK** offers trampolines and climbing walls.

Rogue's sweet spot for families is children aged 8 and above. That's when bowling and karting both become viable activities, and when Flip Out's soft play and toddler zones become less relevant.

### What Rogue Could Do Differently for Families

**Streamline party booking.** If a parent has to phone or email to book a party, that's friction. Every extra step between "I want to book a party" and "it's booked" is a chance for them to give up, get distracted, or look elsewhere. Online party booking with clear packages, prices, and available dates would remove that friction. Plenty of competitors already offer this.

**Post-party follow-up.** After a party, the parent is at peak satisfaction (assuming the party went well, which it usually does based on reviews). That's the moment to send a message: "Glad the kids had a great time. Book your next party within 30 days and get 10% off." Simple. Automated. Costs nothing.

**Birthday reminder automation.** When a party is booked, you already know the child's age and birthday. Capture that. Six weeks before their next birthday, send the parent a reminder: "Is it nearly time for another party at Rogue? Here are this year's packages." Most parents start thinking about party venues about a month before the date. If Rogue is the first suggestion they see, that's half the battle.

### The "Party Parent" Sub-Segment

This is worth calling out specifically. The person who books the party is usually one parent: the organiser. And that parent has a very specific set of needs. They want the booking to be easy. They want to know exactly what's included so there are no surprises. They want the kids to have fun so they look good in front of the other parents. And they want to not be stressed on the day.

Everything about the booking process, the communication, the on-the-day experience, and the follow-up should be designed for that parent. They're the decision maker, the paying customer, and the person who'll either recommend Rogue to their friends or never mention it again.

## Segment 2: Corporates (High Value, Low Volume)

This is probably the biggest untapped revenue opportunity for Rogue right now.

The corporate customer is a team leader, office manager, or HR person at a local business. Aylesbury has a decent number of employers, plus there's a significant commuter population: people who work for London-based companies but live locally. Those companies often have Aylesbury-adjacent offices or run team events near where their employees live.

Typical group size is 10 to 50 people. They're booking team-building days, Christmas parties, summer socials, and departmental away days.

### What Corporates Value

**A professional booking process.** The person booking a corporate event is usually doing it on behalf of their company. They need to justify the spend. They need to show they've done due diligence. They need an invoice. They may need a proposal they can forward to their line manager. If the booking process feels amateurish or requires multiple phone calls to pin down details, they'll go somewhere that makes them look professional.

**Bespoke packages.** No corporate group wants to book off the standard menu and feel like they've got the same thing as a kids' birthday party. They want to feel like the event has been tailored for them. That doesn't mean it actually has to be radically different; it means the language, the proposal, and the communication need to feel bespoke.

**Catering.** Corporate groups expect food and drink as part of the event. They often have dietary requirements that need accommodating. A buffet with a few options, served in a semi-private area, goes a long way.

**Parking and convenience.** Companies choosing a venue for 20 people need somewhere everyone can actually get to. Rogue has parking and is accessible from the town centre. That matters.

**Keeping the group together.** A corporate organiser's nightmare is the group fragmenting. If half the team is bowling and the other half is waiting with nothing to do, the organiser looks disorganised. The ability to rotate groups through bowling, karting, and the escape room, all in one venue, solves that problem completely.

### The Revenue Potential

A family of four might spend 60 to 80 pounds on a visit. A corporate group of 20 will spend 500 to 800 pounds or more, especially if food and drinks are included. That's 5 to 10 times the revenue from a single booking. And corporate groups tend to repeat. The Christmas party happens every year. The summer team day happens every year. The new-starter onboarding event happens every quarter. Once you've got a corporate client, you can keep them for years.

There's another factor worth mentioning. Hybrid working has made in-person team events more important, not less. Companies that have people working from home three days a week actively look for reasons to bring everyone together. Team-building activities are one of the few things that justify getting everyone in the same room. Nationally, 19% of escape room bookings are corporate. That gives some indication of the demand.

### Who's Winning This Segment Right Now

**TeamSport** has dedicated corporate pages, packages, and enquiry forms. **Escape Hunt in MK** markets directly to corporate bookers. **Xscape MK** offers multiple activities under one roof with professional-grade corporate packages. These are the venues that show up when an office manager searches "team building activities Buckinghamshire."

Rogue doesn't currently have a visible corporate offering. There's no dedicated page on the website. No corporate enquiry form. No packages designed for business groups. That means the demand is going elsewhere by default.

### What Rogue Could Do Differently for Corporates

**A dedicated corporate page on the website.** This is the single most important thing. One page that says: "Planning a team event? Here's what we offer for groups. Here are the activities. Here's how to enquire." Include photos of groups having fun. Mention the multi-activity advantage. Make it easy to get in touch.

**A corporate enquiry form.** Capture group size, preferred date, budget, which activities they're interested in, and any dietary requirements. This gives Rogue everything needed to send a tailored proposal without a lengthy phone call.

**Automated proposal generation.** Tony can help build this. Based on the enquiry form inputs, generate a professional-looking PDF proposal that goes out within an hour. Speed matters in corporate bookings. The first venue to send a proper proposal often wins.

**Follow-up automation for previous corporate bookers.** If a company booked their Christmas party at Rogue last December, send them an email in October: "Shall we pencil in your Christmas party again this year? We've got availability on these dates." This is retention at its simplest.

The multi-activity venue is a massive advantage for corporate bookings. A corporate organiser can book bowling, karting, and the escape room for one group in one place. Nobody else in Aylesbury offers that. For a team day where the group rotates through three different activities, Rogue is the only local option. That's a selling point that should be front and centre.

## Segment 3: Young Adults (18 to 28, Groups and Date Nights)

This is the segment that spends at the bar. And bar revenue is a multiplier for leisure venues, because the margins on drinks are significantly higher than on bowling lanes or kart sessions.

The typical young adult customer is a group of four to eight friends looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday evening. Or it's a couple looking for a date night that's more interesting than dinner and a film. Bowling works for this because it's social, competitive, and you can drink while you do it. Karting works because it's exciting and Instagram-friendly. The karaoke room is a natural fit for groups.

### What Young Adults Value

**An experience worth sharing.** This generation photographs and films everything. If the venue looks good, feels good, and produces moments worth posting, that's free marketing. If the venue looks tired or dated, that's a problem because people actively avoid being associated with places that don't match their image.

**A good bar.** This isn't a nice-to-have for this segment; it's core to the proposition. Bowling is the activity. The bar is the reason they stay. Cocktails, decent beer, a bit of atmosphere.

**Competitive socialising.** Bowling isn't a sport for this group. It's a social activity with a competitive edge. They want to beat their mates, have a laugh, and take the mickey out of whoever bowls the gutter ball. The activity is the backdrop; the social interaction is the point.

**A modern, well-maintained venue.** This segment notices when things look worn. They notice the lighting, the music playing in the background, the state of the toilets. First impressions matter disproportionately to this age group.

### Who's Winning This Segment

**Volcano Falls in MK** has three crazy golf courses, bars, and karaoke, all designed for the young adult market. **The Pin** in Aylesbury offers indoor golf simulators with cocktails. **Hollywood Bowl's VIP lanes** specifically target the premium young adult experience with table service.

These venues understand that for 18-to-28-year-olds, the activity is almost secondary to the atmosphere and the social experience.

### What Rogue Could Do Differently for Young Adults

**Social media content that shows the fun.** Not just photos of empty bowling lanes. Show groups laughing. Show someone celebrating a strike. Show the bar. Show the karaoke room in full swing. The content should make someone think "I want to be there on Saturday."

**Off-peak student pricing.** Aylesbury has a college and there are universities within reach. Student discounts on quieter evenings (not Friday or Saturday peak) fill lanes that would otherwise sit empty and introduce a demographic that could become regular customers.

**A loyalty or points system.** This doesn't need to be complicated. Even a digital punch card ("Visit 5 times, get a free game") gives people a reason to choose Rogue over trying somewhere new. Young adults are promiscuous with their leisure choices. Give them a reason to be loyal.

**Themed evenings.** Retro bowling nights. Glow bowling sessions. DJ nights. Anything that turns a regular Tuesday or Wednesday into an event. These don't cost much to organise but create moments people want to attend and share.

**The karaoke room.** This is an asset for the young adult segment that's possibly underutilised. Groups of friends love karaoke, especially after a couple of drinks. Making this a prominent part of the evening offer (not buried in the website, not an afterthought) could drive bookings.

### Bar Revenue Is the Key

It's worth repeating: this segment spends more at the bar than any other. A family of four might buy two soft drinks and a coffee. A group of six friends on a Saturday night will spend 50 to 100 pounds at the bar on top of their bowling. The bar is where the real margin sits for this audience.

---

## Segment 4: Teenagers (13 to 17, the Underserved Market)

Teenagers are in an awkward gap. Too old for soft play and trampoline parks (or at least they think they are). Too young for bars and pubs. Their options for a Friday night out are surprisingly limited: cinema, fast food, or wandering around town centre.

Bowling and karting sit in the sweet spot for this age group. They're exciting, social, don't require adult supervision (though parents often drop off and collect), and feel grown-up enough that a 15-year-old isn't embarrassed to be there.

### The Competitive Situation

There's very little in Aylesbury specifically targeting teenagers. Flip Out skews younger. The Pin is for adults. The cinema is the main alternative, but it's passive. For active, social entertainment aimed at 13-to-17-year-olds, Rogue is almost the only game in town. That's a significant opportunity.

### What Rogue Could Do Differently for Teenagers

**Teen-specific evening sessions.** Friday and Saturday evening slots (say 6pm to 9pm) marketed specifically at teenagers. Give it a name. Make it feel like an event, not just "bowling." These sessions could become a regular fixture in local teenagers' social calendars.

**Group discounts.** Teenagers come in groups. If four friends want to bowl and one can't afford it, they all go somewhere else instead. A group rate (book for 4, save 15%) removes that barrier.

**"Grown-up" birthday packages.** A 15-year-old does not want a party package that looks like it was designed for an eight-year-old. No balloons with cartoon characters. No party bags. They want karting with their mates, then bowling, then food. The package should feel cool, not cute.

**The karting track is a natural draw.** For teenage boys especially (though not exclusively), go-karting is aspirational. It feels like a proper adrenaline activity. The dual-level track with the banked corner and flyover ramp is exactly the kind of thing teenagers will talk about at school.

### Marketing to Teenagers

This requires a different approach from every other segment.

**TikTok over Facebook.** Teenagers aren't on Facebook. They're on TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. Short video content of the kart track, bowling strikes, and groups having fun is what works. It needs to look cool, not corporate.

**Content that looks cool, not cute.** The aesthetic needs to feel more like a Red Bull ad than a soft play flyer. Fast karts, competitive moments, social energy.

**Digital parental consent.** Teenagers under 16 often need parental consent forms for karting. If these have to be printed, signed, scanned, and emailed, that's a barrier. A digital consent form that a parent can complete on their phone in thirty seconds removes that friction entirely.

### Remember: Parents Fund This Segment

Teenagers don't have their own money (or not much of it). The parent is the one paying. So while the marketing needs to appeal to the teenager, the information about safety, pricing, and logistics needs to reach the parent. That might mean the TikTok ad gets the teen excited, and the website reassures the parent that it's safe, well-supervised, and reasonably priced.

---

## Segment 5: Stag and Hen Parties

Multi-activity venues are natural fits for stag and hen parties. A group of 10 to 25 people needs something to do for an afternoon before they head out for dinner and drinks. Bowling, karting, and the escape room are perfect for filling that slot.

Aylesbury is cheaper than London, which matters for stag and hen weekends. Groups that can't afford or don't want a London venue will look for something more affordable within an hour or so of the capital. Aylesbury fits that brief.

### The Opportunity

**Pre-built tiered packages.** Something like: Bronze (bowling and a round of drinks), Silver (bowling, karting, and drinks), Gold (bowling, karting, escape room, drinks, and food). Give people a clear menu of options at clear price points. Nobody planning a stag do wants to email back and forth negotiating a custom package. They want to pick one, pay, and move on.

**Drinks packages.** A set price for a certain number of drinks per person, included in the package. This simplifies things for the organiser and increases bar spend.

**A dedicated stag/hen page on the website.** When someone searches "stag do Aylesbury" or "hen party activities Buckinghamshire," Rogue should appear with a page that speaks directly to that search. Right now, that page doesn't exist. Every search like that is a potential booking going to a competitor or, more likely, going nowhere because the organiser doesn't even know Rogue is an option.

**Partnerships with local restaurants and bars.** The stag or hen party at Rogue fills the afternoon. But the group needs somewhere to go in the evening. If Rogue can recommend (or partner with) a local restaurant and bar, that becomes a more complete proposition. "Book your afternoon at Rogue and your evening at [partner venue]" turns Rogue into the starting point for the whole day, not just a standalone activity.

### Automation for Stag and Hen Bookings

**Enquiry-to-booking automation.** A form that captures the basics (date, group size, package preference, any special requests) and sends back an instant confirmation or a follow-up within an hour.

**Group payment splitting.** This is a perennial headache for whoever organises a stag or hen party. If Rogue can offer a way for each person in the group to pay their share individually (even just a shared payment link), that removes one of the biggest pain points.

**Automated itinerary generation.** Once the package is booked, send the organiser a tidy itinerary they can forward to the group: "2pm arrive, 2:15 bowling starts, 3:15 move to karting, 4:30 escape room, 5:30 drinks at the bar, 6:30 head to dinner." This makes the organiser look competent, which makes them love Rogue, which makes them recommend Rogue to the next person planning a stag do.

---

## Segment 6: Schools and Youth Groups

Schools need outings. Scouts and Guides need activities. Youth clubs need somewhere to go. And they all need it during the week, which is exactly when Rogue's lanes and track are quietest.

This is a weekday revenue driver. Schools book during term time. Youth groups book on weekday evenings. Neither of these conflicts with the weekend family and social trade.

### The Opportunity

**Schools packages with an educational angle.** It might sound like a stretch, but there's a genuine case for framing the activities educationally. The physics of karting (velocity, friction, centripetal force). Problem-solving through escape rooms (teamwork, communication, lateral thinking). Even bowling has maths in it (scoring, angles, averages). Schools need to justify outings as educational. Give them the language to do that.

**Youth club and Scout/Guide rates.** Bulk booking rates for groups of 15 or more at a fixed per-head price. Simple, predictable, easy for a volunteer leader to budget for.

**Automated risk assessment provision.** Every school trip requires a risk assessment. Every time. The teacher or coordinator has to request it, Rogue has to dig it out or write one, and there's back-and-forth about specifics. If Rogue has a standard risk assessment document for each activity (bowling, karting, escape room) that's available to download from the website or sent automatically when a school enquiry comes in, that removes a significant admin burden on both sides. Schools will choose the venue that makes their life easiest, and risk assessment provision is a surprisingly big factor in that decision.

**Invoicing.** Schools don't pay by card on the day. They need an invoice. They pay on 30-day terms through their admin department. If Rogue can accommodate this without friction, it opens the door. If not, schools will go somewhere that can.

---

## Segment 7: Seniors and Daytime Leisure

Bowling is a low-impact, social activity that works for almost any age and fitness level. And weekday mornings are, almost certainly, Rogue's quietest period.

The senior segment isn't going to transform the business. The revenue per head is lower. They won't be ordering cocktails at the bar. But they fill lanes that are otherwise generating zero revenue, and there's a community benefit that shouldn't be underestimated.

### The Opportunity

**Weekday morning bowling sessions.** A regular slot, say Wednesday and Thursday mornings, 10am to 12pm, at a reduced rate. Market it through local community groups, parish newsletters, and social clubs.

**"Coffee and Bowl" combo.** A game of bowling and a hot drink for a set price. Simple, appealing, low-commitment. Perfect for getting people through the door for the first time.

**Bowling leagues.** Weekly or fortnightly leagues for over-60s. This creates a committed, returning group who book the same slot every week. That's predictable revenue and it builds a community around the venue.

**Partnerships with local groups.** Age UK Buckinghamshire. U3A (University of the Third Age). Local social clubs and community centres. These organisations are constantly looking for activities for their members. A phone call to the local Age UK coordinator could fill a midweek morning session.

The financial contribution per session is modest. But it's revenue from time slots that currently earn nothing. And it creates a positive presence in the community that has knock-on effects. The grandparent who bowls on Wednesday morning is the same person who books their grandchild's birthday party on Saturday.

## Which Segments to Prioritise

Not all of these segments deserve equal attention right now. Some are already working well. Some need a bit of improvement. Some are wide open opportunities. Here's how to think about priority.

**Families: Already strong. Focus on retention and automation.** The customers are already coming. The job here is to make them come back more often and make the booking process smoother. Birthday reminder emails, post-party follow-ups, and online party booking are the priorities. This is optimisation, not acquisition.

**Corporates: Biggest untapped revenue opportunity.** This needs a landing page on the website, a proper enquiry form, and a professional-looking proposal process. The revenue per booking is 5 to 10 times a family visit, bookings tend to repeat annually, and they fill midweek slots. This should be near the top of the list.

**Young Adults 18 to 28: High frequency plus bar spend.** This segment needs better social media content and possibly a loyalty scheme. They visit often, spend well at the bar, and talk about their experiences online. Getting this right creates a virtuous cycle of visits, content, and word-of-mouth.

**Teenagers 13 to 17: Underserved locally, low effort to capture.** There's almost no local competition for this age group. Teen-specific evening sessions and TikTok content could capture a group that currently has nowhere to go. The investment required is small relative to the potential.

**Stag and Hen Parties: Medium-to-high value. Needs packages and a landing page.** High spend per head, group sizes of 10 to 25, and these are one-off premium bookings. A dedicated page and pre-built packages are all that's needed to start capturing this demand.

**Schools and Youth Groups: Weekday filler. Needs outreach.** This fills quiet weekday slots with predictable bookings. It requires some outreach (emailing local schools, getting on their approved supplier lists) and some admin preparation (risk assessments, invoicing capability). The per-head revenue is lower but the volume is there.

**Seniors: Lowest priority, but fills dead time.** This is the last segment to pursue actively, but it's worth setting up because it costs very little and fills time slots that are currently earning nothing. A midweek morning session and some community outreach is all it takes.

---

## One Thing That Connects All of These

Every single segment, from families to seniors, from corporates to stag parties, starts their journey in the same place: online. They search. They land on the website (or they don't, because the page they need doesn't exist). They decide whether Rogue looks like the right fit for them.

Right now, Rogue's website speaks mostly to one type of customer: the general visitor who already knows Rogue exists. There's no corporate page. No stag and hen page. No schools information pack. No teen-specific content. No seniors' morning bowling information.

Each of those missing pages is a missed opportunity. Not because the pages themselves are magic, but because they're the front door for each specific audience. When an HR manager searches "team building activities Aylesbury," they need to land on a page that speaks directly to corporate team events. When a hen party organiser searches "hen do ideas Buckinghamshire," they need a page that shows packages, pricing, and how to book.

Building specific pages for specific audiences is how you capture demand that already exists. These people are already searching. They're already spending money somewhere. The question is whether Rogue shows up with the right message at the right moment, or whether they end up at TeamSport, Hollywood Bowl, or Xscape instead.

The building, the activities, the staff, and the location are all already in place. The segmentation work is about making sure the right people know that Rogue is the right venue for them, and making it as easy as possible for them to book.

That's it. Not complicated. Just specific.

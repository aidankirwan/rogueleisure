# AI and Automation Plan for Rogue Leisure

## Who This Is For

This briefing is for Aidan Kirwan, owner of Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury. Aidan runs a 40,000 square foot leisure venue with bowling, go-karting, and an escape room. He's got 29 staff, tight margins, and was recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.

Tony Winyard, a friend of Aidan's who works in AI and automation consulting, put this plan together after a discovery call.

## The Core Insight

Here's the thing about ADHD: Aidan described his brain as having "20 radio stations going at once." Ideas are constantly flowing. Tasks pile up. He knows what needs doing but struggles to execute. By the end of the day, he's mentally exhausted.

The traditional advice is "get more organised" or "use a to-do list." But that misses the point. The problem isn't that Aidan lacks discipline. The problem is that his brain processes information differently, and most business tools are designed for neurotypical people.

So this plan doesn't start with business systems or website improvements. It starts with giving Aidan's brain what it actually needs: **capture tools**.

## Phase 1: The Personal Productivity Stack

Before tackling any business problems, we need to set up three tools that work together. These reduce cognitive load immediately.

### Tool 1: Wispr Flow (Voice-to-Text)

**What it does:** Wispr Flow lets you speak instead of type, anywhere on your computer. Email, documents, messages, notes. You just talk, and the words appear.

**Why this matters for ADHD:** Aidan's brain moves fast. Typing is slow and requires sustained focus on the mechanical act of getting words onto a screen. Speaking is natural. You can capture a thought the moment it occurs, before it disappears.

**How it works in practice:**
- Aidan gets a phone call about a supplier issue. Instead of trying to remember it or scribbling a note, he opens a document, hits a key, and speaks: "Call from Dave at Parts Direct. The brake pads are delayed until Thursday. Need to reschedule the maintenance slot."
- Done. Captured. No friction.

**Cost:** Around £10 per month.

### Tool 2: Granola (AI Meeting Notes)

**What it does:** Granola automatically transcribes and summarises meetings and calls. It captures what was discussed, what decisions were made, and what action items came out of it.

**Why this matters for ADHD:** Meetings are mentally exhausting because you're trying to listen, engage, remember, and plan next steps all at once. With Granola, you can just be present in the conversation. The AI handles the capture.

**How it works in practice:**
- Aidan has a call with his accountant about quarterly numbers.
- After the call, Granola gives him a summary: "Discussed cash flow for March. Agreed to delay the lane maintenance until April. Action: Aidan to send updated revenue forecast by Friday."
- No more "what did we actually decide?" moments.

**Cost:** Around £10 per month.

### Tool 3: Claude (AI Assistant)

**What it does:** Claude is an AI assistant that can help with emails, documents, planning, and thinking through problems. It's like having a very capable colleague available 24/7.

**Why this matters for ADHD:** Sometimes the hardest part of a task is starting. Claude can help break things down, draft a first version, or just be a sounding board when Aidan's brain is stuck.

**How it works in practice:**
- Aidan needs to write a response to a complaint email but doesn't know where to start.
- He pastes the complaint into Claude and says: "Help me write a professional but friendly response. The customer is upset about a kart breakdown during their son's party."
- Claude drafts a response. Aidan tweaks it, sends it. Done in two minutes instead of twenty.

**Cost:** Around £18 per month for Claude Pro.

### Why These Three Together

The magic is in how they connect:

1. **Wispr Flow** captures thoughts and tasks as they happen
2. **Granola** captures meetings and calls automatically
3. **Claude** helps process everything and turn captured information into action

Total cost: Around £38 per month. Less than one bowling party brings in.

## Phase 2: File Structure and Organisation

Before building any business systems, Tony will set up a proper folder structure on Aidan's computer. Separate folders for Bowling, Karting, Escape Room, Staff, Compliance, and Finance.

This sounds basic, but it matters. When Aidan captures a note about kart maintenance using Wispr Flow, there needs to be an obvious place to put it. Organisation reduces decisions, and decisions drain ADHD brains.

---

## Phase 3: Business Systems

Once the capture tools are working, Tony can help build systems to solve specific business problems. These will mostly be built using Airtable, a flexible database tool that's affordable and doesn't require coding.

### Staff Scheduling System

**The problem:** Right now, one of Aidan's team spends 4-5 hours every week building the roster. She has to check bookings across three different systems, then contact zero-hour staff individually to check availability.

**The solution:** An Airtable system where:
- Staff submit their availability each week via a simple form
- Booking data feeds in from the three systems
- The system suggests a roster based on availability and demand
- Aidan or his manager reviews and approves

Time saved: 3-4 hours per week. That's over 150 hours per year.

### Digital Compliance Checklists

**The problem:** Paper checklists everywhere. Fire alarm tests, kitchen temperatures, kart maintenance logs, tyre records. Paper gets lost. If someone forgets a check, nobody knows until there's a problem.

**The solution:** Tablets at key locations. Staff complete checklists digitally. Everything is timestamped, logged, and searchable. If a mandatory check is missed, managers get an automatic alert.

This isn't just about convenience. It's about insurance and compliance. When an inspector asks for maintenance records, Aidan can pull them up in seconds instead of digging through filing cabinets.

### Booking Dashboard

**The problem:** Three separate booking systems (QubicaAMF Conqueror X for bowling, Book My Karting for go-karting, Resova for the escape room). Nobody can see total demand across all activities without checking three different places.

**The solution:** A simple dashboard that pulls data from all three systems and shows upcoming bookings in one view.

Note: This one depends on whether the booking systems have APIs (ways for other software to connect to them). Tony will need to investigate during the site visit.

## What This Costs

| Tool | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Wispr Flow | £10 |
| Granola | £10 |
| Claude Pro | £18 |
| Airtable | £18 |
| **Total** | **£56/month** |

That's less than £700 per year. The staff scheduling system alone saves enough hours to pay for it many times over.

Tony's time to set all this up is separate, but because he's using AI tools to build the systems, the cost is dramatically lower than traditional development. We're talking hundreds, not thousands.

## The Website (Brief Mention)

Tony also looked at the Rogue Leisure website and found some opportunities:

- **No customer reviews visible** - The business has good ratings on Google and TripAdvisor, but none of that social proof appears on the website
- **No photos of the actual track** - The dual-level layout with the banked corner is a genuine selling point, but visitors can't see it
- **Escape room page is thin** - Missing basic information like pricing and duration

These are fixable, and Tony has written up specific recommendations. But the personal productivity tools come first. Website improvements can wait until Aidan has the mental bandwidth to think about them.

## What Happens Next

1. **Tony will visit** - Come to the venue, see the systems in person, understand how things actually work day-to-day
2. **Set up the capture tools** - Install Wispr Flow, Granola, and Claude on Aidan's computer
3. **Train Aidan and key staff** - Show them how to use the tools in their actual workflow
4. **Build the business systems** - Starting with whatever will have the biggest immediate impact (probably the scheduling system)

Aidan doesn't need to configure anything or learn any technical skills. Tony handles the setup. Aidan just needs to be open to trying new ways of working.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't about fixing something broken. Rogue Leisure is a successful business. Aidan has built something impressive.

But ADHD creates a constant tax on mental energy. Every unmade decision, every task that falls through the cracks, every meeting where you can't remember what was agreed: these add up. By the end of the day, there's nothing left.

The tools in this plan don't change who Aidan is or how his brain works. They just give that brain the support system it needs to work the way it naturally wants to.

Voice instead of typing. Automatic capture instead of manual notes. AI assistance instead of staring at a blank screen.

Small changes. Big relief.

# Technology and Trends in the UK Indoor Leisure Industry

## Who This Is For

This briefing is for Aidan Kirwan, owner of Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury. It covers where the indoor leisure industry is heading, what the big chains are doing with technology, and what it all means for a 40,000 square foot independent venue with bowling, go-karting, and an escape room.

Tony Winyard, Aidan's friend and AI consultant, put this together to give Aidan a clear picture of the forces shaping his industry and the technology decisions that matter most right now.

## Where the Leisure Industry Is Heading

The competitive socialising market in the UK has been on a tear. Between 2018 and 2023, the number of venues grew by roughly 40%. That's bowling, mini golf, karting, axe-throwing, escape rooms, and everything else where people go out to do something together rather than just eat or drink.

Within that market, bowling makes up about 15% of venues, mini golf 11%, and pool and snooker 10%. But the fastest-growing segments tell you where the energy is. Axe-throwing venues grew by 162%. Mini golf grew 96%. These are activities that barely existed ten years ago, and now they're everywhere.

The numbers on visit frequency are encouraging too. 41% of visitors to competitive socialising venues now go at least once a month. That's not occasional. That's habitual. People have built leisure activities into their regular routines, not just saved them for birthdays and stag dos.

But here's where it gets more nuanced. Consumers are spending more carefully. Only 13% of people say their discretionary spending will be higher in 2026. 54% are concerned about the cost of living. Those are big numbers, and they sound worrying if you run a leisure business.

The good news is that experiences remain a priority even when budgets tighten. Entertainment and travel are increasingly viewed as essentials, not luxuries. People are still spending on leisure. They're just more selective about where and how they spend. They want better value and more memorable experiences for their money.

Hollywood Bowl's financial results tell this story perfectly. Their spend per game went up 9.2%, but the total number of games played went down 7.5%. Fewer people through the door, but each person spending more. That's premiumisation in action. VIP lanes, better food, table service, cashless arcades. Everything designed to increase the value of each visit rather than just chasing volume.

What does this mean for Rogue? The market is growing, but customers are pickier. They'll pay more for a good experience, but they won't pay anything for a mediocre one. The venues that invest in quality, convenience, and memorable moments are the ones that will thrive. The ones that stand still will slowly lose ground to operators who are moving forward.

## The Technology Gap: Where Rogue Sits Today

Let's be honest about where things are right now. This isn't a criticism. Loads of independent venues are in exactly the same position. But it's important to see it clearly so the priorities make sense.

Rogue runs three separate booking systems. QubicaAMF Conqueror X handles bowling. Book My Karting handles go-karting. Resova handles the escape room. None of these systems talk to each other. Staff have to check three different dashboards to understand what's happening across the venue on any given day.

Compliance is all on paper. Temperature checks, kart maintenance logs, opening and closing routines, fire safety records. Paper checklists everywhere. Paper gets lost. Scanning backlogs pile up. And if someone misses a check, nobody knows until there's a problem or an inspector asks a question you can't answer quickly.

There's no central file storage. Documents are scattered across individual computers. If Aidan needs a specific file and the person who saved it isn't around, good luck finding it.

Email is on Exchange, but there's no real Microsoft ecosystem behind it. No Teams, no SharePoint, no shared calendars that actually work. Communication happens, but it's informal and fragmented.

There's no customer database or CRM. Customer data lives inside those three booking systems, and it stays there. Nobody is pulling together a picture of who visits, how often they come back, what they book, or when their birthday is. That means no targeted marketing, no follow-up emails, no birthday offers, no review requests after visits.

There's no loyalty programme or membership scheme of any kind. A customer who visits ten times gets treated exactly the same as a first-timer.

Again, this is the reality for a lot of independent operators. Running a busy leisure venue with 29 staff, tight margins, and three different activities doesn't leave much time for technology projects. But the big chains are investing heavily in exactly these areas, and the gap between what they offer and what independents offer is getting wider every year.

## What the Big Chains Are Doing with Technology

It's worth understanding what the well-funded operators are building, because their customers are the same people who visit Rogue. When someone has been to a Hollywood Bowl with at-lane ordering and a cashless arcade, they notice when those things aren't available elsewhere.

**Hollywood Bowl** has gone furthest. Their arcades are fully cashless. Customers load credit onto cards or wristbands and use those to play. No coins, no change machines, no staff counting out cash at the end of the night. It's cleaner operationally and it increases spend because people don't feel the pain of handing over physical money.

They've introduced at-lane drink ordering. You don't have to leave your lane to get a drink. You order from your seat and someone brings it to you. This is genius for two reasons: it increases food and beverage spend (people order more when it's easy), and it keeps customers at their lanes longer, which makes the whole experience feel more premium.

Dynamic pricing is another big one. Hollywood Bowl charges different prices depending on when you play. Friday evening costs more than Tuesday afternoon. This fills the quiet slots (people chase the cheaper prices midweek) and maximises revenue on the busy ones (people pay a premium for the time they actually want). Most modern booking systems can handle this.

They've also converted 97% of their estate to Pins on Strings pinsetter technology. Instead of the traditional pinsetting machinery that's been around since the 1950s, pins hang from strings and get lifted back into position. It's cheaper to maintain, has far less downtime, and means fewer breakdowns. The customer experience is almost identical, but the operational savings are significant.

**TeamSport** has taken a different approach, building a digital ecosystem around repeat visits. They have a dedicated app for booking and managing your account. They run a 4-tier membership programme, from about eight quid a year up to thirty-five, with each tier offering different benefits: discounted sessions, priority booking, birthday perks, free helmet liners, and so on. They have a loyalty points system where every pound spent earns points, and 600 points gets you a free race session. They also run the Race Academy for kids, which is a structured programme of sessions where children learn racing techniques over time. All of this is designed to turn a one-time visitor into a regular.

**Gravity Active and the Xscape venues** use RFID wristbands for cashless payments throughout the venue. Customers load money onto a wristband on arrival and tap to pay everywhere. They've also introduced digital waivers (sign on a screen instead of filling in paper forms) and automated session timing so activities start and stop precisely.

The common thread across all of these operators is the same. They're using technology to do two things. First, reduce friction. Make it easier to book, easier to pay, easier to come back. Remove every possible barrier between the customer wanting to do something and actually doing it. Second, collect data. Every cashless transaction, every app booking, every loyalty card scan gives them information about who their customers are, what they like, when they visit, and how much they spend. That data powers their marketing, their pricing decisions, and their investment choices.

## Electric Karts: The Industry Shift

This one isn't urgent for Rogue, but it's important to know where the karting industry is heading.

Electric go-karting is projected to be 44% of the total karting market by 2035, growing at about 9.2% per year. That's not some distant fantasy. It's a steady, measurable shift that's already underway.

TeamSport's Reading venue already has electric karts. K1 Speed, which used to be Capital Karts, is pushing electric karting internationally. The direction of travel is clear.

The advantages of electric are real. No fumes, which matters because Rogue has had ventilation complaints in reviews. Lower maintenance costs, because electric motors are simpler than petrol engines and don't need rebuilding. Quieter, which means a better experience for customers doing non-racing activities nearby (nobody wants to have a conversation over the sound of fifteen petrol engines). Better torque and acceleration, which actually makes the racing more exciting for customers. And there's the environmental messaging, which matters more to customers every year.

The downsides are real too. Replacing a fleet of petrol karts with electric is a significant capital investment. You need charging infrastructure. And there's a segment of karting enthusiasts who see petrol as the "real" experience and electric as somehow lesser.

Nobody's saying Rogue needs to switch tomorrow. But when the existing kart fleet eventually needs replacing, electric should be seriously on the table. The economics, the customer experience, and the operational simplicity all point in the same direction.

## Unified Booking Platforms: The Dream vs Reality

One of the biggest operational headaches at Rogue is having three separate booking systems that don't communicate. The dream is a single platform that handles everything. Now that we know what the three systems actually are, let's look at what's possible.

The three systems are **QubicaAMF Conqueror X** for bowling, **Resova** for the escape room, and **Book My Karting** for go-karting. Each is from a different vendor, built on different technology, with very different integration capabilities.

**Resova** is the good news story. It has a full REST API with webhooks. That means it can automatically push data to other tools when something happens, like a new booking or a cancellation. It already integrates with MailChimp and Google Calendar (two-way sync). Setting up a webhook to push escape room bookings into a Google Sheet is straightforward and could be done quickly. Resova was acquired by Clubspeed in 2022, which is interesting because Clubspeed makes family entertainment centre software for karting and bowling. That acquisition might open up a consolidation path in the future.

**QubicaAMF Conqueror X** is a big, established platform used by over 10,000 bowling centres in 90 countries. QubicaAMF is also the company that makes Rogue's physical pinsetters and lanes, so there's already a relationship there. They have a developer portal for API access, but it requires authorisation from your QubicaAMF representative. It's not publicly documented the way Resova's API is. The software suite includes something called Conqueror XRM, which is a CRM and loyalty module with points, tiers, purchase history, and targeted promotions. This might already be included in Rogue's licence but not switched on. That's worth checking because it could give Rogue a loyalty programme for bowling without buying anything new.

**Book My Karting** is the trickiest one for integration. It's made by Smart Entertainment, a small UK company based in Lichfield that's been going since 1998. They've processed over 73 million pounds in bookings, so they're established and reliable. But there's no public API. If you want to connect it to anything else, you'd need to contact Smart Entertainment directly and ask what's possible. In the meantime, they do offer CSV and PDF export for reports, so a weekly manual export to a Google Sheet is the practical short-term option.

**ROLLER** is probably the most relevant unified platform if Rogue ever decides to consolidate. It's trusted by over 2,000 attractions worldwide and has a London office. It handles ticketing, point of sale, CRM, digital waivers, gift cards, memberships, and cashless wallets. It supports bowling, karting, and multiple activity types under one roof. Dynamic pricing is built in. In November 2025, they launched an AI assistant called ROLLER iQ that helps operators with data insights and recommendations. Pricing sits somewhere in the range of 310 to 825 pounds per month, depending on what you need. That's a significant investment, but remember what it replaces: three separate systems, no CRM, no loyalty programme, no unified data.

**Clubspeed** is worth knowing about because it was designed specifically for family entertainment centres that combine karting and bowling. It has a documented API for custom integrations, integrates with MyLaps timing for karting, and offers 24/7 phone support. And since Clubspeed now owns Resova, there might be a natural path where Rogue's escape room system and a new unified platform come from the same company.

The practical approach right now isn't replacing all three systems. It's getting data from all three into one place:

1. Set up Resova webhooks to automatically push escape room bookings to a Google Sheet
2. Ask Rogue's QubicaAMF rep about API access and whether QPortal reports can be scheduled or emailed
3. Weekly CSV export from Book My Karting to a Google Sheet
4. A simple Google Sheet dashboard that pulls from these three sheets to show total bookings across all activities

That gives Rogue a single view of the whole business for the first time. It's not perfect, but it's a massive improvement over checking three separate dashboards. A unified platform like ROLLER is a medium-term goal. Worth investigating properly. Worth budgeting for. But not something to rush into.

## Digital Compliance and Safety Tools

This section matters more than it might sound, because compliance failures are one of the few things that can genuinely shut a leisure venue down overnight.

**Trail** costs 38 pounds per site per month and is purpose-built for hospitality and leisure. Digital checklists, smart scheduling that assigns the right tasks to the right people at the right times, real-time alerts when checks are missed, and an AI assistant that staff can ask questions about procedures. It has a 14-day free trial, so you can test it without commitment.

**SafetyCulture** (also known as iAuditor) offers a free tier for up to five users, with premium features at roughly 20 pounds per user per month. It converts paper checklists to digital in minutes. Completed checks include photo evidence and GPS stamps, creating automatic audit trails.

Rogue's immediate plan is simpler than either of these, and that's fine. Google Forms on the new Samsung tablets, saving responses to Google Drive. This costs nothing extra because it's included in Google Workspace. Staff tap through their checklists on a tablet instead of ticking boxes on paper. The responses are timestamped, stored automatically, and searchable. If the business outgrows this approach or needs more sophisticated features, Trail or SafetyCulture can be the next step.

But why does digital compliance actually matter? It's not just about convenience.

Health and safety records must be kept for a minimum of five years. Accident records must be kept for three years under RIDDOR regulations. Equipment examination reports must be kept until the next examination or two years, whichever is longer. For go-karting specifically, there are HSE regulations, ADIPS safety standards, and requirements for documented maintenance schedules.

If there's ever an HSE inspection, or worse, an insurance claim after an accident, the quality of your records becomes the single most important factor. Digital records with timestamps, photo evidence, and complete audit trails are far more defensible than paper in a cupboard. Paper can be lost, damaged, backdated, or simply incomplete. A digital system that logs exactly who did what, when, with photographic proof, is the difference between a straightforward inspection and a serious problem.

This is one of those areas where the move from paper to digital isn't about being modern or trendy. It's about protecting the business.

## AI: What's Real and What's Hype

There's a lot of noise about AI right now. Every tech company is claiming their product is "powered by AI." Most of it is marketing. Here's an honest breakdown of what's genuinely useful for a business like Rogue, split by timeframe.

### Real and Useful Right Now

**Voice-to-text (Wispr Flow)**: This is already being set up for Aidan. Instead of typing emails, notes, and reports, you speak and the words appear on screen. For someone with ADHD, this is a genuine productivity shift. Thoughts get captured the moment they occur, before they disappear. No friction, no struggling with keyboards, no half-finished emails.

**AI meeting notes (Granola)**: Automatically captures and summarises calls and meetings. Records what was discussed, what was decided, and what the action items are. No more "what did we agree?" moments two days later. Aidan can be fully present in conversations instead of trying to listen, engage, and take notes simultaneously.

**AI writing assistant (Claude)**: Drafts emails, responses to complaints, marketing copy, staff communications. The value isn't that it writes perfectly. The value is that it gets you past the blank page. You start with something, then tweak it. Two minutes instead of twenty.

**Chatbots for customer enquiries**: Rogue is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. That's two days a week when potential customers can't get answers to basic questions. A chatbot on the website can answer routine queries around the clock. "What are your prices?" "Can my eight-year-old go karting?" "Do you do parties?" "Where do I park?" Start with a proper FAQ page on the website. Add a chatbot later once the common questions are documented.

**AI phone receptionist**: A step up from the chatbot. An AI answers the phone, handles routine questions, and captures details for a callback when the question needs a human. UK providers start from about 30 pounds a month. Useful for those closed days and for busy periods when staff can't get to the phone.

### Coming Soon (One to Two Years)

**AI-powered dynamic pricing**: Instead of manually setting different prices for peak and off-peak times, an AI analyses booking patterns and adjusts prices automatically based on demand. Higher when lots of people want to book, lower when slots need filling. This already exists in some platforms (ROLLER is heading in this direction) but it's not yet mature enough for most independent operators.

**Predictive staffing**: Uses historical booking data to recommend how many staff are needed per shift. Instead of building the roster based on gut feel, the system tells you "next Saturday looks similar to the last three Saturdays, you'll need eight staff, not six." This saves money on overstaffing and prevents the chaos of understaffing.

**Automated marketing**: AI creates and schedules social media posts based on what's worked before. It identifies which types of posts get the most engagement, which times of day perform best, and generates content that follows those patterns. Not quite ready for prime time, but getting close.

### Further Out (Three to Five Years)

**Fully autonomous booking and scheduling systems**: The booking system doesn't just take reservations. It manages capacity across all activities, suggests optimal scheduling, handles rebooking when things change, and communicates with customers automatically.

**AI-driven customer experience personalisation**: The system knows that a particular family always books bowling on Saturday afternoons and usually adds food. It sends them a personalised offer on Thursday. It knows a group of mates comes for karting every other month and sends them a reminder when they're "due." It knows someone had a bad experience last time and flags them for extra attention on their next visit.

### The Key Message on AI

Aidan doesn't need to chase every shiny new AI tool. The three tools being set up right now (Wispr Flow, Granola, and Claude) solve his immediate, daily problems. They reduce cognitive load, capture information that would otherwise be lost, and get past the blank-page paralysis that ADHD creates.

Everything else can come later, in the right order, when the basics are working and there's bandwidth to think about the next step.

## Consumer Behaviour Trends That Matter

Technology is only half the picture. The other half is understanding how customers are changing the way they find, choose, and experience leisure activities.

**Mobile-first booking.** Over 70% of leisure bookings now start on a mobile phone. Not a laptop, not a desktop. A phone. This means every part of the booking process, from finding the venue to choosing an activity to paying, needs to work perfectly on a small screen. Rogue's website already works well on mobile, which is good. But the booking journey through those three separate systems might not be as smooth on mobile as it could be.

**Experiences over things.** The post-pandemic shift toward spending on experiences rather than material goods is real and it's sticking. People would rather spend 50 quid on an evening of bowling and drinks with friends than 50 quid on something they'll put in a cupboard. This is good news for every leisure venue. The demand is there.

**Social media as discovery.** Younger customers, particularly under-30s, increasingly find new venues through Instagram and TikTok rather than Google. They see a friend's story from a night out at a bowling alley, or a TikTok video of someone flying round a karting track, and that's how they discover the place. This is why growing the Instagram following (currently at 952) matters. It's not vanity. It's visibility to the demographic that's most likely to organise group outings.

**Group decision-making.** For leisure activities, the decision about where to go is almost never made by one person in isolation. It happens in a WhatsApp group or an iMessage thread. Someone says "shall we do something Saturday?" and then someone else starts looking at options and sharing links. The person who does the research and shares the links is the "organiser," and they need to be able to sell the idea to everyone else in the group. That means Rogue needs shareable links that look good in a message preview, clear pricing that's easy to screenshot or paste, and a booking process simple enough that the organiser doesn't give up and suggest something else instead.

**Sustainability.** There's a growing expectation that businesses take environmental responsibility seriously. This isn't yet the top factor in choosing a leisure venue, but it's increasingly visible. Electric karts, recycling, energy-efficient lighting, reducing single-use plastics. These things matter to a growing number of customers, and they're starting to appear in reviews and social media commentary. Not the top priority, but worth being aware of.

## What This Means for Rogue: Three Priorities

This is a lot of information. Industry trends, technology platforms, AI tools, consumer behaviour. It can feel overwhelming, especially when the day-to-day reality is running a busy venue with 29 staff and three activities to manage.

So here are the three priorities, in order. Not everything at once. One step at a time.

### Priority 1: Get the Basics Digital

This is what's happening on Monday. Paper checklists move to tablets. Scattered files move to Google Drive. Exchange email moves to Gmail and Google Workspace. The personal productivity tools (Wispr Flow, Granola, Claude) get set up on Aidan's computer.

This isn't glamorous. Nobody's going to write a case study about a business switching to Google Drive. But it's the foundation that everything else depends on. You can't build a customer database if you don't have a central place to store it. You can't do digital compliance if your checklists are still on paper. You can't save time with AI tools if they're not installed and working.

Get the basics right first. Everything else follows from there.

### Priority 2: Build a Customer Database

Even a simple spreadsheet of everyone who's booked. Names, email addresses, what they booked, when they visited. This sounds basic, and it is. But it's the single most valuable asset a leisure business can build, and right now Rogue doesn't have one.

With a customer list, you can send email marketing. Birthday offers. "We haven't seen you in a while" reminders. Requests for Google reviews after visits (reviews are one of the biggest drivers of new customers finding you). Announcements about new activities, special events, or seasonal promotions.

Without a customer list, every marketing effort starts from scratch. You're always trying to attract new customers instead of bringing back the ones who've already visited and had a good time.

A customer database also enables a loyalty programme when the time is right. You can't reward repeat customers if you don't know who they are.

This doesn't require a fancy CRM on day one. A Google Sheet, regularly updated, is a perfectly good starting point.

### Priority 3: Start Thinking About a Unified Booking Platform

ROLLER or Clubspeed as a medium-term goal. Not urgent, not something to rush into, but worth investigating properly.

We now know what the three systems are and what integration options exist. Resova (escape room) has a full REST API with webhooks, which is excellent. QubicaAMF Conqueror X (bowling) has a developer portal, though access requires authorisation from the QubicaAMF representative. Book My Karting (go-karting) has no public API, so CSV export is the main option for now.

The practical first step is to get data from all three systems into Google Sheets: Resova via webhooks (automatic), QubicaAMF via scheduled reports or API (pending access), and Book My Karting via weekly CSV export (manual). That gives Rogue a single view of bookings across all activities for the first time.

## Wrapping Up

The indoor leisure industry is in a strong position. People want experiences. They're willing to pay for good ones. The competitive socialising market is growing, visit frequency is high, and Aylesbury's population growth means more potential customers every year.

The challenge for independent operators like Rogue is keeping pace with the technology investments that the big chains are making. Not matching them pound for pound, because that's impossible and unnecessary. But closing the most important gaps: digital compliance, customer data, and a booking experience that doesn't require staff to check three separate dashboards.

The good news is that the first steps are cheap and practical. Google Workspace, Samsung tablets, a few AI tools that cost less than 40 quid a month between them. These aren't flashy investments. They're foundations.

The medium-term goal of a unified booking platform is a bigger decision with a bigger price tag. But it doesn't need to happen this month or even this quarter. What needs to happen is the groundwork: getting digital, getting organised, getting a customer database started.

Aidan has built something impressive in Aylesbury. A genuine multi-activity venue in a growing town with staff that customers remember by name. That's not something technology can replicate. The technology is there to support what already works and to close the gaps where the business is currently flying blind.

Small steps. Right order. No rush.

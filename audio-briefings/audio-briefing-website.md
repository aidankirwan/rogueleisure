# Website Improvements for Rogue Leisure

## The Starting Point

Aidan's website for Rogue Leisure is functional. It's not broken. The navigation is clear, the pricing is visible, there are "Book Now" buttons throughout, and it works on mobile. These basics are covered.

But there are opportunities being missed. The website could be working harder to turn visitors into bookings. This briefing covers the main gaps and what can be done about them.

The site is built on Webflow, which is a visual website builder. That's actually good news because it means changes can be made without needing to write code. The key question is whether Aidan has direct access to the Webflow editor, or whether an agency controls all the updates. If an agency is involved, that might explain any frustration with costs or delays.

## The Biggest Missing Piece: Social Proof

Here's something interesting. Rogue Leisure has strong ratings online. Over 4.5 stars on Google. Good reviews on TripAdvisor. Customers praise the staff, the safety briefings, the track layout.

But none of this appears on the website.

A visitor to rogueleisure.co.uk has no idea that hundreds of other people have had great experiences there. They can't see the reviews. There are no testimonials. No quotes from happy customers.

This is the single biggest quick win. Pull the best quotes from Google and TripAdvisor reviews and add them to the homepage and the activity pages. Real customers saying real things about their experience.

"The staff were brilliant with the kids." "Best karting track we've been to." "Perfect for my son's birthday party."

These kinds of quotes build trust instantly. They reduce the hesitation that comes before clicking "Book Now."

Time to implement: Two to three hours.

## Show What Makes You Different

Rogue Leisure has a genuinely special karting track. It's dual-level, with a ramp section and a banked corner that customers specifically mention in reviews. It's 350 metres of challenging layout. And unlike the big chains that have switched to electric karts, Rogue still runs petrol Honda engines that give you the real visceral experience.

But can visitors see any of this on the website?

Not really. The karting page shows pictures of karts, but not the track itself. You can't see the dual-level section. You can't see the banked corner. You can't visualise what makes this different from any other indoor karting venue.

Same with bowling. There are 14 lanes, party rooms, an arcade. But the website doesn't show what the space actually looks like. People booking a birthday party want to picture their kids there.

The fix is straightforward: take photos. Show the track layout from an angle that captures the levels. Show the bowling lanes with the lighting and atmosphere. Show the party rooms set up for a celebration. Let people see what they're booking.

Time to implement: Half a day to take the photos, then a couple of hours to upload them.

## The Escape Room Page Needs More

Rogue has an escape room called "Crazy Cat Lady." The theme sounds fun, quirky, family-friendly. But the page for it is thin.

There's no pricing shown. No mention of how many people can play (it's 2-10, which is actually quite flexible). No duration (60 minutes). No difficulty rating. No age recommendations.

Someone looking at this page has to click through to an external booking system just to find out basic information. And every extra click is a chance to lose them.

The fix: Add the key details directly to the page. Price per person. Group size range. How long it takes. How hard it is. Whether it's suitable for children. This isn't complicated content, it just needs to be there.

Time to implement: One to two hours.

## Answer Questions Before They're Asked

Think about someone considering Rogue Leisure for the first time. They have questions:

What should I wear for karting? Do I need to bring anything? Where do I park? Is there a cost for parking? What if I need to cancel? How early do I need to arrive? What age can my child do the karting? How tall do they need to be?

None of these questions are answered on the website in any obvious place.

Every unanswered question creates friction. Either the person calls to ask (which takes up staff time), or they decide it's too much effort and book somewhere else.

An FAQ section solves this. Either one central page, or FAQ sections on each activity page. Cover the obvious questions. Make it easy for people to find answers without having to call or click away.

The karting page especially needs a prominent note about arriving 45 minutes early. Burying that in small print means late arrivals, frustrated customers, and disrupted sessions.

Time to implement: Two to three hours.

## Walk First-Timers Through the Experience

Related to the FAQ point: someone who's never been to Rogue Leisure doesn't know what to expect. What happens when I arrive? Where do I check in? What's the process before I get on the track? How long does the safety briefing take?

A "What to Expect" section answers this. It walks people through the experience from arrival to finish. This is especially valuable for karting, where there's a specific process involving waivers, safety briefings, and equipment.

It's also valuable for parents booking a kids' party. They want to know exactly how the day will flow. When does the bowling start? When do they move to the party room? What food is included?

Reducing uncertainty makes people more confident about booking.

Time to implement: Two to three hours.

## Corporate Bookings Are an Opportunity

Rogue Leisure can host corporate events. Team building. Work parties. Group outings. But there's no dedicated page on the website for this.

Someone searching for "team building activities Aylesbury" or "corporate events Buckinghamshire" should land on a page that speaks directly to their needs. What packages are available? How many people can you accommodate? What does the day look like? How do I get a quote?

Corporate bookings are high-value. A company organising a team event will spend significantly more than a family booking a bowling session. But if they can't find clear information on the website, they'll look elsewhere.

The fix: Create a dedicated corporate/groups page. Outline the options. Include testimonials from companies who've held events there. Add an enquiry form for custom quotes.

Time to implement: Four to six hours.

## A Note About SEO

There are some technical things that could help more people find the website in search results. Things like schema markup (which helps Google understand what the business is), optimised page descriptions, and landing pages targeting specific searches like "bowling parties Aylesbury."

These aren't urgent, but they're worth considering once the basics are in place. A longer-term option would be creating blog content around topics like "best birthday party ideas in Aylesbury" or "karting tips for beginners." This kind of content can attract local search traffic over time.

## One Important Caveat

All of these website improvements will help convert more visitors into bookings. But there's something worth mentioning that came up in the customer reviews.

The most common negative feedback about Rogue Leisure isn't about the website. It's about equipment reliability. Karts breaking down during sessions. Bowling lanes having mechanical issues.

When these things happen, customers compare the experience unfavourably to the bigger chains in Milton Keynes. The "local and friendly" advantage disappears if the equipment doesn't work properly.

The website brings people in. Reliability keeps them coming back. Website improvements are worthwhile, but they work best alongside operational reliability.

## Practical Next Steps

If Aidan wants to act on any of this, here's where to start:

First, check the Webflow access situation. Can you log in to the editor directly, or does everything go through an agency? If an agency controls access, consider getting login credentials. You shouldn't need to pay someone every time you want to add a testimonial or update a photo.

Second, gather some photos. Either take new ones or pull together existing images of the track, the lanes, the party rooms. These don't need to be professional photography. Decent smartphone photos with good lighting are fine.

Third, collect testimonials. Go through the Google and TripAdvisor reviews and screenshot or copy the best ones. Get a mix covering different activities: karting, bowling, parties, escape room.

Fourth, decide what matters most. You don't have to do everything at once. Testimonials and photos are probably the highest impact for the least effort. Start there.

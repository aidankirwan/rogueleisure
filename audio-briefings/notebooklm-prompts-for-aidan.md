## 1. Competitors

**Source document:** `audio-briefing-competitors.md`

### Custom Prompt

This briefing is for Aidan, who owns Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury (bowling, go-karting, escape rooms, arcade, karaoke, bar). He has ADHD and prefers listening to reading. He's never done competitor research and has very little awareness of what other venues are doing.

**Key points to emphasise:**

1. **Frame it positively.** This isn't about Rogue being behind. It's about knowing what customers are comparing them to, so Aidan can make smarter decisions.

2. **Hollywood Bowl is the bowling benchmark.** They've spent £450k on refurbs, introduced VIP lanes with table service, dynamic pricing, and cashless arcades. They're extracting more money per customer even though fewer people are bowling. The lesson isn't "spend £450k". It's that small premiumisation moves (designating 2 lanes as premium, table service, dynamic pricing) can increase revenue without adding customers.

3. **TeamSport is the karting benchmark.** Their 4-tier membership and loyalty points system drives repeat visits. Rogue has nothing equivalent. Even a simple stamp card would be a start. The Race Academy for kids 8-15 is also clever because it creates regular revenue from a specific age group.

4. **Flip Out Aylesbury is the most direct local threat.** Right in town, from £5.50, huge variety of activities. Competes hard for the same family leisure spend.

5. **Xscape MK is the elephant in the room.** Bowling, trampolining, skiing, skydiving, golf, escape rooms, restaurants, all under one roof. Rogue can't compete on breadth but CAN compete on convenience, price, and personal service. And Aylesbury's population is growing 14.2%.

6. **Be honest about the gaps.** No loyalty scheme, no VIP tier, no corporate page, limited food menu, small Instagram following. But also be honest about the strengths: only multi-activity venue in Aylesbury, distinctive karting track, amazing staff.

7. **End with three practical actions.** Visit one competitor. Start a loyalty scheme (even a stamp card). Create a corporate page.

**Tone guidance:**
- Two friends having an honest conversation, not a consultant delivering bad news
- Specific names and numbers, not vague generalities
- Encourage Aidan to visit Hollywood Bowl MK or Flip Out as a customer
- Keep it around 25-30 minutes

## 2. Marketing Opportunities

**Source document:** `audio-briefing-marketing.md`

### Custom Prompt

This briefing is for Aidan, who owns Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury. He has ADHD and a part-time marketing person. He has 8,800 Facebook followers and his best content is real people and real stories (an 87-year-old lady karting, his granddaughter bowling). He wants to move away from cartoony Canva graphics.

**Key points to emphasise:**

1. **Start with what's working.** 8,800 Facebook followers is strong. The authentic content already outperforms the polished stuff. Aidan's instincts are right.

2. **Instagram is massively underused.** 952 followers vs 8,800 on Facebook. The karting track, the bowling atmosphere, the escape room are visually rich. Short video clips get 2-3x more reach than static images. Getting Instagram connected to Meta Business Suite (which Tony showed him during the visit) means posting to both platforms at once.

3. **Reviews are a goldmine that's not being mined.** 4.5+ stars on Google but none of those reviews appear on the website. Pulling the best quotes onto the homepage is the single biggest quick win. And there's no system for asking customers to leave reviews after their visit.

4. **The FAQ page saves phone calls AND improves Google rankings.** People search for "what to wear go karting Aylesbury" and get no answer from Rogue. Every unanswered question is either a phone call or a lost booking.

5. **Corporate marketing is money being left on the table.** No corporate page on the website. Companies searching for "team building Aylesbury" can't find Rogue.

6. **Email marketing hasn't started.** Every customer who books has given their email. That's a database waiting to be used. Birthday reminders, monthly newsletters, event follow-ups.

7. **End with three things to do this week.** Connect Instagram. Send 5 reviews to Jane for the website. Set up a QR code review card.

**Tone guidance:**
- Encouraging and energising, not overwhelming
- Lots of "you're already doing this well, here's how to do more of it"
- Practical actions, not marketing theory
- Keep it around 25-30 minutes

## 3. Customer Segments

**Source document:** `audio-briefing-customer-segments.md`

### Custom Prompt

This briefing is for Aidan, who owns Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury. He has ADHD and runs a 40,000 sq ft venue with bowling (70% of revenue), karting (25%), and escape rooms (5%). Breakeven is £80k/month. 29 staff, 22 on zero-hour contracts. Closed Monday and Tuesday.

**Key points to emphasise:**

1. **Frame this practically.** This isn't academic marketing theory. It's about understanding that different types of customers want different things, and if you market to each group differently, you make more money from the same building.

2. **Families are the bread and butter** but there's room to improve retention. Birthday reminder automation (capture the date, send a reminder 6 weeks before) and post-party rebooking incentives are easy wins. The "party parent" is the decision maker and everything should be designed to make their life easier.

3. **Corporates are the biggest untapped opportunity.** A corporate booking for 20 people is worth 5-10x a family of four. They come back annually. Hybrid working has made in-person team building more important. Rogue's multi-activity venue is perfect for this. But there's no corporate page on the website, so they're invisible to this audience.

4. **Teenagers 13-17 are underserved locally.** Too old for soft play, too young for bars. Karting and bowling are ideal. Low competitor intensity. This is a relatively easy segment to capture.

5. **Stag and hen parties are premium bookings** that could be attracted with pre-built packages and a landing page. Aylesbury is cheaper than London.

6. **Schools fill weekday gaps.** The venue is closed Monday and Tuesday, but even Wednesday to Friday during term time has quiet periods that schools could fill.

7. **The priority order matters.** Don't try to chase all seven segments at once. Families first (optimise what's working), corporates second (biggest revenue opportunity), young adults third (bar revenue), and the rest follows.

8. **Everything connects to the website.** Every segment needs a front door. Corporate page, stag/hen page, schools page, FAQ for families. These are specific pages for specific audiences.

**Tone guidance:**
- Make each segment feel like a real person, not a demographic label
- Use examples Aidan can picture ("imagine a PA searching for team building venues")
- Acknowledge that Aidan already knows his customers well; this is about being more deliberate
- Keep it around 25-30 minutes

## 4. Technology and Trends

**Source document:** `audio-briefing-tech-trends.md`

### Custom Prompt

This briefing is for Aidan, who owns Rogue Leisure in Aylesbury. He has ADHD and is about to start a technology transformation: moving from paper checklists to digital, from Exchange to Google Workspace, and installing AI tools (Wispr Flow, Granola, Claude). He has three separate booking systems that don't talk to each other.

**Key points to emphasise:**

1. **Start with where the industry is heading.** The competitive socialising market grew 40% in venues between 2018 and 2023. Hollywood Bowl's spend per game is up 9.2% despite volumes declining. The trend is fewer visits but higher spend per visit. Premiumisation works.

2. **Be honest about where Rogue sits.** Three separate booking systems, paper checklists, no central file storage, no CRM, no loyalty programme. This isn't a criticism. Most independent venues are in the same position. But the big chains are investing heavily and the gap is widening.

3. **Show what the chains are doing.** Hollywood Bowl with cashless arcades, at-lane ordering, and dynamic pricing. TeamSport with memberships, loyalty, and a Race Academy app. The common thread is reducing friction and collecting customer data.

4. **Electric karts are coming.** 44% of the market by 2035. Not urgent for Rogue right now, but when the fleet needs replacing, electric should be seriously considered. It solves the ventilation complaints that have appeared in reviews.

5. **A unified booking platform (ROLLER or Clubspeed) is the dream** but it's a medium-term goal (£310-825/month). The immediate win is getting the three current systems to share data somehow.

6. **AI: be clear about what's real now versus hype.** Wispr Flow, Granola, and Claude are real and useful today. AI phone receptionists are real. Dynamic pricing AI is coming soon. Autonomous booking systems are further out. Aidan doesn't need to chase every shiny tool.

7. **The three priorities are simple.** Get the basics digital (Monday's plan). Build a customer database. Start thinking about a unified platform later.

8. **Keep it grounded.** Aidan is about to make a big step forward with Google Workspace, tablets, and AI tools. That's more than most independent venues are doing. The technology conversation is about knowing what's possible, not about doing everything at once.

**Tone guidance:**
- Informative but not overwhelming
- "Here's what's out there, here's what matters for you, here's what can wait"
- Acknowledge that change is hard, especially with ADHD, and that the phased approach is exactly right
- Specific numbers and product names, not vague trends
- Keep it around 25-30 minutes

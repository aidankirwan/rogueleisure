# Roadmap

## Current Sprint
- Install Google Drive for Desktop on both laptops and migrate rogueleisure repo from OneDrive
- Cancel Microsoft 365 / Exchange (only after Google Drive confirmed working on both laptops and email DNS verified on Google Workspace)

## Upcoming
- Authenticate Granola MCP in Claude Code (OAuth flow on first session start)
- Approve Wispr MCP server in Claude Code on first session start

## Backlog
- Update .mcp.json server paths after Google Drive migration (OneDrive → My Drive)

## Completed
- Set up Granola MCP integration (official remote server at mcp.granola.ai)
- Set up Wispr Flow MCP integration (local Python server reading flow.sqlite)
- Added Granola and Wispr workflow sections to CLAUDE.md
- Established cross-device sync strategy: OneDrive (→ Google Drive) + Git/GitHub

## Brand Origin Story

The name "Rogue" comes from Star Wars. When Aidan worked at Waitrose, he was a Star Wars fan and had a go-kart team called **Rogue Squadron**. They raced with their own kart and created lads' weekends away. As it got more professional, they called it **Rogue Racing**. Then Aidan had what he describes as a "midlife crisis" and bought the go-kart track in Milton Keynes, keeping the Rogue Racing name. When they moved to Aylesbury and added bowling and other activities, it became **Rogue Leisure** to reflect the multi-activity offering.

## Social Media and Marketing

- **Facebook:** ~8,800 followers. Aidan is personally active on social media.
- **Instagram:** Not yet connected to Meta Business Suite. Tony walked Aidan through connecting it during the visit.
- **Best performing content:** Real people, real stories. Two standout examples:
  - "Welcome all ages" post featuring Aidan's granddaughter -- high engagement
  - An 87-year-old lady who came karting -- "amazing engagement"
- **Content direction:** Aidan wants to move away from cartoony Canva-style graphics toward authentic content. Real people and real stories work best.
- **Marketing person:** A young lady who also works for a charity. Does bits on Canva and ChatGPT. Creates Valentine's Day, February half-term promotions, etc. Not full-time.
- **Gift cards:** Now available (recently launched on website).
- Something has about 20-24 sign-ups (context unclear from transcription -- possibly a bowling league or promotion).

---

## Website

- **Not a blocker.** Built on Webflow by Jane (a friend) for £800.
- Jane hardly charges for updates. "The website is fine."
- Aidan just needs to tell Jane specifically what to change.
- **Plan:** Tony's website analysis document can serve as the brief for Jane. Aidan can email it to her or have his marketing lady highlight the top four priorities.
- Aidan acknowledged he knows the website needs updating but keeps putting it off ("one of those things that keeps going, 'Yeah I'm ready to do it but don't do it'").

## ADHD and Reporting Style

Aidan's ADHD means long text documents won't get read. All reports, dashboards, and summaries created for him must be visual first: charts, graphs, colour coding, traffic light indicators (red/amber/green). Lead with a visual overview; put detail underneath for Dawn or anyone else who wants to drill down. This applies to compliance dashboards, financial summaries, booking reports, and anything else that might otherwise be a wall of numbers or text.

## Aidan's Stated Priorities (In His Own Words)

### Priority 1: "I want me sorted"
Personal productivity tools. Voice-to-text. Talking to his computer. "I want people to think I've gone mad and I'm talking to my computer but it's actually doing the work for me." Help producing reports, dictating emails. Freeing him up means he can do more and chase revenue-generating activities. He has emails that would generate sales but hasn't gotten to them yet.

### Priority 2: Central File Storage with Access Levels
"Almost like a server, almost what's one in intranet from company." All folders accessible with different access levels. Managers can feed in and pull out information. He referenced a shared area from when he worked for a trust. He wants something similar but with security levels.

### Priority 3: Digital Checklists on Tablets
Replace paper with tablets. Specific requirements:
1. Doris on the bar does the temperature check -- goes into the temp folder
2. Pete does the kart check -- goes into the kart folder
3. Management overview: "Each week because we're closed two days, I expect five temp checks. If there ain't five temp checks in that week, can I have an alarm go off saying 'Aidan, you need to look at it' or 'Dawn, you need to look at this'?"

### Priority 4: Structure to Manage Managers
The digital checklists and alerts help him "manage my managers." Dawn and other managers can go in and check compliance without Aidan chasing.

## Ecosystem Decision: Google Workspace

- Currently on **Exchange** for email (10 accounts) but using it for email only. No central file storage.
- Aidan was **positive about Google Workspace** when Tony suggested it.
- **H&S person already uses Google Shared Drive** for compliance docs (cart maintenance reports, fire alarm checks, monthly sign-offs). This is an internal staff member.
- Aidan is platform-agnostic: "I'm not so familiar with Microsoft. I'm quite happy to rip everything up and use a system that's potential."
- Emails can be ported from Exchange to Gmail.
- Google Workspace gives: Drive, Docs, Sheets, Gmail, Gemini AI, Forms -- all under one roof.
- Key question from Aidan: "Would we be able to port the [email] so anyone can access it? You obviously get permission but everyone is able to access it from their own computer. You don't need to have a network?"

## Current Paper Processes (Observed On-Site)

Tony photographed paper checklists during the visit:

### Bar & Reception Open Checklist
- Tasks include: machine refills, hot water urn, AM fridge/freezer temp checks, postmix taps check, restocking, wash machine (noted "BROKEN"), ovens/fryers/microwaves check, food date labels, pizza boxes availability, pool table check (10 balls, 2 cue balls), clean and set up areas
- Dawn signed off most items. Dated 5/2/26.

### Bar & Reception Close Checklist
- Tasks include: PM fridge/freezer temp checks, email checking, dishwasher, hot water urn off, slush machines off, spirit measures, bottle tops, ice bucket, glass wash machine, seating/tables wiping, pool balls returns (max 8 on returns), postmix syrups, toilet/sink cleaning, rubbish collection, mopping all floors
- Multiple staff signed off (Ellie, Pam, Samantha, Dawn). Signed by Duty Manager. Dated 5/2/26.

### Scanning Backlog
H&S person and Dawn both have "loads of paperwork lying around." H&S person is behind on scanning paper forms to Google Drive. Accident report forms are "locked away in a cupboard -- it's easy for things to fall between a crowd." Digital forms eliminate the scanning step entirely.

## Booking Systems

The three booking systems were discussed during the meeting but detail was lost in the Wispr Flow transcription. Aidan confirmed the system names via WhatsApp on 6 Feb 2026:

| Activity | System | Vendor | Admin URL |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Bowling | **QubicaAMF Conqueror X** | QubicaAMF Worldwide (also manufactures Rogue's pinsetters and lanes) | Via QubicaAMF portal |
| Escape Room | **Resova** | Resova Ltd (acquired by Clubspeed LLC in 2022) | https://login.resova.com |
| Go-Karting | **Book My Karting** | Smart Entertainment Limited, Lichfield | https://admin.bookmykarting.co.uk/bmk/login.aspx |

**Cost:** ~£600/month total for all three systems. Aidan said he would welcome something cheaper that combines all three into one.

**Customer-facing problems (observed by Tony on website):**
- Each activity links to a completely different booking interface. Bowling, karting, and escape room all look different. Inconsistent and confusing for customers.
- **No multi-activity booking.** Customers cannot book bowling + karting (or any combination) in a single transaction. They have to go through separate booking flows for each activity, which contradicts Rogue's core USP of "everything under one roof."
- **Upselling is reactive, not proactive.** Aidan cross-sells in person once customers are already on-site ("you've finished karting, we've got a bowling lane free, I'll give you a lower price"). This works but misses everyone who would have booked multiple activities online if given the option, and the on-the-spot discount is likely more generous than what a booking-time package deal would require.

**Integration potential (researched post-meeting):**
- **Resova** has a full REST API with webhooks (best integration potential of the three)
- **QubicaAMF** has a developer portal at developer.qubicaamf.com (requires authorisation from QubicaAMF rep)
- **Book My Karting** has no public API (CSV/PDF export only)

---

## Financial Record-Keeping

All accounting is done manually in **Excel**. Every evening, staff take all money received and details from online bookings and enter the data into Excel columns by hand. This duplicates data that already exists inside the three booking systems and is time-consuming, error-prone, and archaic. A unified booking platform with built-in reporting (or even automated exports from the current systems to Google Sheets) would eliminate most of this manual work.

---

## Customer Data and Email Marketing

- **No contact database exists.** Rogue has no centralised list of customer email addresses, phone numbers, or booking history.
- **No automated emails of any kind.** No post-visit follow-ups, no birthday reminders, no review requests, no rebooking prompts, no abandoned cart recovery.
- **GDPR paralysis is the root cause.** Aidan doesn't know what GDPR allows and what it doesn't, so the default has been to do nothing. No marketing emails, no customer communications beyond the transactional booking confirmations sent by the three booking systems.
- **Massive missed opportunity.** Every customer who books through Resova, QubicaAMF, or Book My Karting provides their email address. That data exists inside the booking systems but is never used for retention, upselling, or review generation.

---

## Alpha Timing System (Karting)

- **Alpha** was recommended to them (~£400/year) but **never actually adopted**.
- It has a garage/service record feature where you can log maintenance per kart, view service history, record engine reconditioning dates, etc.
- Key concern: "Once you come away from Alpha you don't own those documents anymore; you have to export them out before you leave, otherwise you lose your garage and all your service records."
- **Decision:** Tablet-based digital records owned by Rogue (stored in Google Drive) are safer than being locked into Alpha's ecosystem.
- Aidan liked the idea of kart-specific service sheets: "I think what would be nice if you had a tablet that you went in and you had a list of cart numbers. You go cart 12; it pulls up the service sheet."

---

## Hardware

- **No tablets currently** (only a couple of Kindles used for Crazy Cat Lady escape room disclaimers).
- Aidan is happy to buy **Samsung tablets** at £60-70 each with cases. "I've only used those in companies before because inevitably they're gonna get dropped."
- Also has a **touchscreen Windows machine** somewhere that could be useful.

---

## Key Staff Referenced

- **Dawn** -- Manager. Would receive alerts for missed compliance checks. Signs off checklists. Has paperwork backlog.
- **Doris** -- Bar staff. Would do daily temperature checks.
- **Pete** -- Karting. Would do kart maintenance/pre-session checks.
- **Ellie, Pam, Samantha** -- Bar/reception staff (seen on closing checklist).
- **Marketing lady** -- Part-time, also works for a charity. Does Canva and ChatGPT content.
- **H&S person** -- Internal staff member. Already uses Google Shared Drive for compliance docs.
- **Jane** -- External friend/developer. Built and maintains the Webflow website.

---

## Quick Wins Identified by Aidan

When asked "What are the quick wins?":
1. Voice-to-text for emails and reports (Wispr Flow)
2. File organisation and central storage with access levels (Google Workspace)
3. Digital checklists with alerts (Google Forms on tablets)
4. Sorting the filing system
5. Getting the unsent sales emails out

---

## Other Notes

- Aidan offered to show Tony the paper forms used daily and then continue the conversation over lunch.
- Aidan mentioned wanting AI to be "smart" enough to create the checklists AND auto-file them to the correct folder.
- He asked whether the AI/checklist system should be compatible with Google Drive or whether there's something better.
- The current Exchange setup: "It's only email" -- staff find it easy to use but it doesn't do anything beyond email.
- Fire/weekly alarm check documents: "December 2025 is his monthly check for being signed off" -- currently paper that gets scanned (when H&S person gets round to it).

## Discovery Questions to Ask

### Systems (see the dashboards)
- [ ] What's the actual name/vendor of each booking system? Open the admin panels.
- [ ] Do any have APIs, export options, or Zapier connectors?
- [ ] What's the Microsoft setup? Exchange only or M365? Who has licences?
- [ ] Where are files stored? (Local spreadsheets? Email? Nowhere?)

### Operations
- [ ] How many phone calls per week for routine questions? (AI receptionist ROI)
- [ ] Walk me through how a corporate enquiry comes in and gets handled
- [ ] How many corporate bookings per month? What's the close rate?
- [ ] Show me the paper checklists -- which ones are legally required?
- [ ] Who does social media? How much time per week?

### Strategy
- [ ] Revenue by month -- what are the peaks and troughs?
- [ ] Why closed Mon-Tue? Would you open for guaranteed corporate bookings?
- [ ] Any plans to expand the escape room offering? Add a second room?
- [ ] Have you considered electric karts? (Removes fume complaints, lower maintenance)
- [ ] What's the food/drink plan? Any ambition beyond pizzas and hot dogs?
- [ ] Do you have an email/customer list? How big?
- [ ] GDPR: privacy policy covering all three booking systems? ICO registered?

### Customer Insights
- [ ] Who are your best customers? Families, corporates, young adults, other?
- [ ] What ages are the kids party bookings? (Under 10? 10-13? Teens?)
- [ ] Do you get stag/hen enquiries? Schools?
- [ ] What do customers complain about most?
- [ ] What brings people back for a second visit?

## Top Competitors (Conversation Starters)

**"How do you feel about Hollywood Bowl MK?"** -- 19 lanes, VIP tier, dynamic pricing, £450k refurb. They're extracting 9.2% more per game. But they're 30 min away and impersonal.

**"Does TeamSport Dunstable come up?"** -- 500m track, 4-tier membership, Race Academy for kids. 37 venues nationally. But Rogue's banked corner and dual-level layout are genuinely special.

**"What about Flip Out?"** -- Right in Aylesbury. Ice skating, mini golf, laser quest, ninja tag, soft play. From £5.50. Competes hard for families.

**"Are you losing people to Xscape MK?"** -- The mega-destination: bowling, trampolining, skiing, skydiving, crazy golf, escape rooms, cinemas, restaurants. All under one roof.

## Quick Win Ideas to Mention

| Idea | Cost | Impact |
|------|------|--------|
| FAQ page on website | Free (Webflow) | Reduces calls, improves SEO |
| Trail for digital checklists | £38/month | Compliance, insurance protection |
| M365 upgrade for SharePoint/Teams | £65-94/month | Central file storage, stops the spreadsheet chaos |
| VoucherCart for gift cards | ~£30/month | New revenue stream, especially Christmas |
| Post-visit review request automation | Free-£20/month | Builds Google reviews, surfaces issues |
| Staff scheduling tool (Rotaready) | £30-175/month | Saves 3-4 hrs/week on roster building |

## Chatbot Recommendation (If It Comes Up)

**Not for today, but medium-term:** Start with an FAQ page (free, immediate), then add a chatbot once you know what customers actually ask.

Three options depending on who maintains it:
- **Tidio** (£30-70/month) -- Aidan self-manages, easiest
- **Crisp** (£80/month) -- WhatsApp + web + Instagram in one inbox
- **Botpress** (£0-50/month) -- Tony builds and maintains, most powerful

**Also consider:** AI phone receptionist (from £30/month) -- might have higher ROI than a website chatbot if phone calls are the bigger time drain.

---

## ICPs Beyond the Obvious Three

Beyond families, corporates, and young adults:
- **Teenagers 13-17** -- underserved, low competition, Friday/Saturday evening sessions
- **Stag/hen parties** -- Aylesbury cheaper than London, multi-activity venue perfect for this
- **Schools/youth groups** -- weekday revenue filler, educational framing possible
- **Seniors** -- daytime bowling leagues, community groups

---

## One Thing to Remember

Rogue's real USP: **the only place in Aylesbury where you can bowl, race karts, do an escape room, sing karaoke, play arcade games, and have a drink, all under one roof.** Nobody else in town can say that. The job is to make that USP easier to discover (website/chatbot), easier to book (systems), and more operationally reliable (compliance/maintenance).

*Good luck. Buy Aidan lunch.*

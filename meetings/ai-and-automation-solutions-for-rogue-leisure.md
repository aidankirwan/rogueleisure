# AI and Automation Solutions for Rogue Leisure

**Date:** Tuesday, 03 Feb 2026

## Business Overview & Challenges

*   **Venue:** Rogue Leisure Limited (Aylesbury) – A **40,000 sq ft** warehouse facility.
*   **Revenue Streams:**
    *   **Bowling:** 14-lane alley (70% of revenue).
    *   **Indoor Go-Karting:** (25% of revenue).
    *   **Escape Room:** Opened Jan 15 (5% of revenue).
*   **Financial Pressure:** Requires **£80,000 monthly revenue** to break even.
    *   **Rent:** £23,000
    *   **Salaries:** £30,000
    *   **Maintenance/Utilities:** £27,000
*   **Staffing:** 29 total staff, with **22 on zero-hour contracts**.
*   **Leadership Context:** Owner (Tony) recently diagnosed with **adult ADHD**.
    *   **Strengths:** Creativity, interpersonal skills, customer service.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Organization, task follow-through, and administrative "procrastination."

## Current Systems & Pain Points

*   **Fragmented Booking Systems:** Three separate systems require manual consolidation:
    *   **Cubicle System:** Used for bowling (integrated with lane controls).
    *   **Bespoke System:** Used for karting.
    *   **Resolver System:** Inherited from the escape room franchise.
*   **Manual Administration:**
    *   Weekly roster creation takes **4–5 hours** manually.
    *   Staff must be contacted individually to check availability.
*   **Paper-Based Processes:**
    *   Health & Safety documentation.
    *   Go-kart maintenance schedules and tire logs.
    *   Opening/closing procedures and kitchen temperature checks.
*   **Microsoft Ecosystem Issues:**
    *   10 email accounts on an **Exchange plan**, but no central file storage (SharePoint/OneDrive).
    *   Lack of proper licensing for all staff; rosters are managed on local spreadsheets.
*   **Calendar Fragmentation:** Usage is split between **Google Calendar** (DJ work), **Microsoft Outlook** (business), and a **Family Diary**.

## Automation & AI Opportunities

*   **Custom App Development:** Transitioning from expensive legacy software to affordable custom apps (costing hundreds rather than tens of thousands).
*   **Digital Checklists:** Replacing paper with tablets for:
    *   **Maintenance Schedules:** Automatically filed and searchable for insurance/compliance.
    *   **Operational Logs:** Temperature checks and fire alarm tests logged centrally.
    *   **Management Alerts:** Automated triggers if a mandatory check is missed.
*   **System Integration:**
    *   Consolidating the three booking systems into a single dashboard.
    *   **Predictive Staffing:** Using booking data to automatically recommend staffing levels.
*   **ADHD Support Tools:** Implementing organizational AI to act as a "second brain" for Tony, capturing tasks from conversations and syncing disparate calendars.

## Next Steps

1.  **Communication:** Tony to provide contact details via **WhatsApp** (preferred channel).
2.  **Site Visit:** Aidan to visit the Aylesbury site to review current processes and identify "quick wins."
3.  **Information Sharing:** Tony to share:
    *   Website and Facebook page details for business context.
    *   Current Microsoft setup details to evaluate **SharePoint/Teams** implementation.
    *   Brochures or operational documents for review.

## Meeting Transcript: Feb 3

**Tony:** There's loads going on, but it's a very tight business. If something major goes wrong, it can put us over the edge. To give you an idea, the average price point is around £20–£30, and each month, I’ve gotta make £80,000 to survive. My rent is £23k, salary bill is £30k, and then maintenance, electricity, and rates are another £27k. We’ve been running since March and invested back into it. We just signed another five-year lease.

I’ve also got my DJ world, which is really busy. I’m booked nearly every Saturday through June or July. On top of everything, I’ve just been diagnosed with **adult ADHD**. My superpower is creativity and people skills, but where I lack is organization. I know what I want to do, but getting it done is a different story. I go home mentally exhausted because my brain has "20 radio stations" going at once.

**Aidan:** I’ve been making notes. There are a few things that would amaze you—simple solutions to help with repetitive tasks. You mentioned the Microsoft ecosystem; are you using **Office 365**?

**Tony:** Yes and no. The documents are there, but the staff don't have licenses. We do rosters on a spreadsheet, which is a repetitive weekly pain. It’s manual because we only put people on when we’re busy. I have three separate booking systems: **Cubicle** for bowling, a bespoke one for karting, and **Resolver** for the escape rooms. I need an automation that looks at all three and tells me what’s coming up and how many people I need to staff. Currently, one of the girls spends four or five hours a week just doing the roster and ringing zero-hour staff.

**Aidan:** Have you dabbled with AI?

**Tony:** I know it does clever stuff. I use **ChatGPT** for some social media posts and forms, but that’s it. I need management tools. I’ve told my team to "manage me"—if they need something, they have to sit me down at the computer and make me do it right then.

**Aidan:** Custom apps are no longer mega-expensive. What used to cost tens of thousands now costs hundreds or low thousands. We can make these systems communicate.

**Tony:** We have no cash to bust, but I can sell the idea to my directors if it saves time. We have paper checklists everywhere—fire alarms, kitchen temperatures, go-kart maintenance. I want those on a tablet. If someone doesn't do a check, I want a flag to go to the managers.

**Aidan:** I think the best thing is for me to spend an hour in your office looking at the systems. I’ll go for a walk, let this soak in, and come back to you with some ideas.

**Tony:** Sounds good. I’m in Aylesbury—**Rogue Leisure Limited**. I’ll send my details over via WhatsApp. We have 10 emails on an Exchange plan, but no central folders. If you want to come up, I’ll buy you lunch and you can see the "quick wins."

# Content Writer (Rogue Leisure)

Strategic content creation for Rogue Leisure. Combines proven copywriting frameworks with the venue's distinctive personality.

## Scale to Task

Not every piece of content needs the full workflow. Match effort to scope:

| Task | What to do |
|---|---|
| Social media post | Quick context check, write in Rogue voice, scan for banned words |
| Review response | Check platform, write warm response, reference something specific |
| Email reply | Check who it's to, draft in friendly tone, keep it short |
| Event promotion | Context, choose framework (PAS or AIDA), write, check for banned words |
| Party package description | Context, write clearly with all key info, check |
| Corporate enquiry reply | Context, professional but warm, include specific details, check |
| Website page copy | Full process: context, framework, write, edit, verify |

## Step 1: Context (Never Skip This)

Before writing anything, know:

1. **Who is this for?** (Families? Corporate booker? Young adults? Teenagers?)
2. **What do we want them to do?** (Book? Call? Share? Leave a review?)
3. **Where will this appear?** (Facebook, Instagram, Google review response, email, website?)
4. **What tone fits?** (Excited? Grateful? Informative? Urgent?)

## Step 2: Choose a Framework (For Longer Content)

**PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)** -- Default for most content
- Problem: What's the reader's situation?
- Agitate: Why does it matter?
- Solution: How Rogue fixes it

Example: "Struggling to find something the whole family actually enjoys? (Problem) The cinema's too passive, soft play's too young, and everyone's bored of the same restaurants. (Agitate) At Rogue, you've got bowling, go-karting, an escape room, and arcade games under one roof. Something for everyone, one booking, zero arguments. (Solution)"

**AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)** -- For ads, short posts, promotions
- Attention: Hook them in one line
- Interest: Give them a reason to care
- Desire: Make them want it
- Action: Tell them what to do

**BAB (Before - After - Bridge)** -- For testimonials, transformation stories
- Before: What was it like before?
- After: What was it like after?
- Bridge: How did Rogue make it happen?

## Step 3: Write in Rogue's Voice

**Rogue Leisure sounds like:**
- Your mate who owns a bowling alley and genuinely loves it
- Fun, welcoming, slightly cheeky
- Locally proud (Aylesbury, not trying to be Milton Keynes)
- Real people, real stories (an 87-year-old lady karting, Aidan's granddaughter bowling)
- Confident but not cocky

**Rogue Leisure does NOT sound like:**
- A corporate chain ("Dear valued customer")
- A marketing agency ("Exciting news!")
- Overly polished or fake
- Desperate for bookings

**Content types and tone adjustments:**

| Content Type | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Social media (real moments) | Warm, proud, personal | "This legend turned 87 last week and celebrated by doing 10 laps of our track. Absolute hero." |
| Party packages | Helpful, clear, enthusiastic | "Everything sorted. Bowling, pizza, party room, and zero stress for you." |
| Corporate enquiry reply | Professional but still human | "Sounds like a great team. We can do bowling, karting, and escape room rotations for groups up to 30." |
| Review response | Grateful, specific, genuine | "Thanks Sarah! Glad the kids loved the karting. The banked corner gets everyone." |
| Event promotion | Exciting, urgent, clear | "Half-term sorted. Book karting, bowling, or both. Slots filling up fast." |

## Step 4: Anti-AI Edit

Before finalising, scan for these banned words and replace them:

**Never use:** delve, unlock, realm, landscape, elevate, game-changer, seamless, empower, unleash, harness, tapestry, testament, navigate, leverage, robust, cutting-edge, dive into, comprehensive, at its core, in today's world, and here's the kicker, without further ado, look no further, stands out from the crowd, take it to the next level, brings to the table, rest assured, second to none, above and beyond

**Also avoid:**
- "We're thrilled to announce..." (just say what it is)
- "Don't miss out!" (unless there's a genuine deadline)
- Exclamation marks more than once per post
- Starting with "Hey there!" or "Hey guys!"

## Step 5: Quick Verification

Before marking content as done:

- [ ] Does it sound like Rogue, not like a marketing agency?
- [ ] Would Aidan actually say this?
- [ ] Is there a clear action (book, call, visit, share)?
- [ ] No banned words?
- [ ] British English? (colour, organised, favourite)
- [ ] No em dashes?
- [ ] Short paragraphs?

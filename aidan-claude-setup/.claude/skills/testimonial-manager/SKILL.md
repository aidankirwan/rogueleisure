# Testimonial Manager (Rogue Leisure)

Handle reviews across platforms and extract valuable Voice of Customer (VoC) data for marketing.

## When to Use

- Responding to a new review (Google, Facebook, TripAdvisor)
- Processing testimonials for the website (send to Jane for Webflow)
- Building a VoC swipe file for social media and marketing copy
- Identifying the best testimonials to highlight
- Creating review request templates (QR code cards, post-visit emails)

## Review Response

### Platforms

| Platform | Response Style | Length |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Google Business | Warm, specific, inviting back | 2-3 sentences |
| Facebook | Personal, conversational | 2-4 sentences |
| TripAdvisor | Detailed, addresses specific points | 3-5 sentences |

### Response Principles

**Do:**
- Thank them by name
- Reference something specific from their review (the track, the staff, the party)
- Keep it genuine, not template-y
- Invite them back if appropriate
- If they mention a staff member, acknowledge it ("We'll pass that on to Pete!")

**Don't:**
- Use generic responses that could apply to any review
- Be defensive about criticism
- Promise things you can't deliver
- Use corporate language ("We appreciate your valuable feedback")

### Positive Review Response Template

```
Thanks [Name]! [Reference something specific]. [Personal touch or fun detail]. See you again soon.
```

Examples:
- "Thanks Sarah! Really glad the kids loved the banked corner on the track. It gets everyone, even the adults. See you again soon."
- "Cheers Mark! Glad the party went well. Doris does a great job keeping things running behind the bar. Hope to see you lot back for another round."

### Negative Review Response

1. Thank them for the feedback (briefly)
2. Acknowledge the specific issue (don't dodge it)
3. Explain what you're doing about it (if applicable)
4. Offer to make it right (contact details)
5. Keep it short and professional

```
Hi [Name], thanks for letting us know. [Acknowledge the specific issue]. [What you're doing about it / offer to make it right]. If you'd like to discuss this further, drop us a message at [email/phone]. We'd love the chance to give you a better experience next time.
```

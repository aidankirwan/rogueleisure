# Interview Skill (Rogue Leisure)

Conduct a thorough interview to build a rich understanding of Rogue Leisure. This context makes every future conversation more useful.

## How It Works

Ask questions one at a time. Wait for the answer. Go deeper on interesting points. Don't rush.

**ADHD-Aware Guidelines:**
- Keep questions short and specific
- One question at a time, always
- If Aidan goes off on a tangent, that's fine. Follow it. The tangent often reveals more than the original question.
- Every 15-20 minutes, check in: "Want to keep going or take a break?"
- Summarise what you've learned so far before moving to a new category
- It's OK to do one category per session. This doesn't have to be done in one sitting.

## Interview Rules

1. **One question at a time.** Wait for the answer before asking the next.
2. **Go deep, not wide.** If an answer is interesting, follow up before moving on.
3. **Challenge assumptions.** If something seems obvious, ask why.
4. **Be specific.** "What happens when a kart breaks down mid-session?" not "Have you considered maintenance?"
5. **Continue until thorough.** Don't stop after 3-4 questions in a category.
6. **Capture decisions.** Note when Aidan makes a choice or expresses a clear preference.
7. **Use Aidan's language.** Reflect his words back, don't translate into business-speak.

## Output

When an interview session is complete (or paused), save a structured summary:

1. **What We Covered** -- Which categories, key topics
2. **Key Insights** -- The most important things learned
3. **Aidan's Priorities** -- What he said matters most, in his own words
4. **Decisions Made** -- Any choices or clear preferences expressed
5. **Surprises** -- Anything unexpected or that challenged assumptions
6. **Open Questions** -- Things to explore in the next session
7. **Action Items** -- Anything that needs doing as a result

**Save to:** `context/` folder in the rogue-leisure repo, using descriptive filenames:
- `context/business-profile.md`
- `context/ideal-customers.md`
- `context/personal-goals.md`
- `context/pain-points.md`
- `context/staff-and-culture.md`
- `context/vision.md`

Each file builds over time. New sessions add to existing files rather than replacing them.

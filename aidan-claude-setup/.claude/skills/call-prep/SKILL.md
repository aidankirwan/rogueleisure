# Call Prep Skill (Rogue Leisure)

Prepare for calls and meetings, then process notes into clear next steps.

## When to Use

**Before a call:**
- "Prep me for my call with [supplier/company/person]"
- "I'm meeting with [person] tomorrow"
- "Help me prepare for the staff meeting"

**After a call:**
- "Process this call" (paste Granola notes)
- "Here's what happened in my meeting with [person]"
- "Draft a follow-up for [person]"

## Part 1: Call Preparation

### What I Need From You

**Required:**
- Who you're speaking to and what it's about

**Helpful if you have it:**
- Any emails, messages, or notes from previous conversations
- What you want to get out of the call
- Any concerns or questions you want to raise

### Where I Look for Context

1. **Project files** -- `context/` folder for business profile, customer insights, pain points
2. **Meeting history** -- `meetings/` folder for previous meeting notes
3. **Implementation plan** -- `deliverables/` folder for what's been agreed

### Call Types and What to Prepare

| Call Type | Key Prep |
|-----------|----------|
| **Supplier** | Current arrangement, what you want to change, market alternatives |
| **Corporate enquiry** | Their group size, date, what activities suit them, packages and pricing |
| **Booking system vendor** | Current pain points, must-have features, budget, timeline |
| **Staff meeting** | Agenda items, recent issues, upcoming events, rota changes |
| **Tony (consultant)** | Progress since last session, what's working, what's stuck, questions |

### Prep Output

I'll give you:
1. **Quick summary** -- Who they are, what this is about
2. **Your goal** -- What you want from this call
3. **3-5 key questions** -- The things you need to ask
4. **Watch out for** -- Things to be aware of

## Part 2: Post-Call Processing

### What I Need From You

Paste your Granola transcript or notes. Even rough notes are fine. I'll make sense of them.

### What I'll Produce

1. **Summary** -- What the call was about (2-3 sentences)
2. **Key decisions** -- What was agreed
3. **Action items** -- Who needs to do what, by when
4. **Follow-up needed** -- Anything that needs a response
5. **Draft follow-up message** -- If appropriate (email, WhatsApp, text)

### Follow-Up Draft

For corporate enquiries, I'll draft a follow-up email that:
- Thanks them for the call
- Confirms what was discussed
- Includes next steps
- Keeps the Rogue Leisure tone (friendly, professional, not corporate)

For supplier calls, I'll draft a follow-up that:
- Confirms agreements
- Notes any pricing or terms discussed
- Lists action items for both sides

### Where to Save

- Meeting notes go to `meetings/` folder
- Action items get flagged for your attention
- Follow-up drafts ready to copy-paste and send

# Patterns

Approaches that work well and should be reused. Claude checks this folder to find proven methods before suggesting new ones.

## How to Add a Pattern

Create a new .md file describing what works and why (e.g., `party-booking-followup.md`).

Include:

1. **What it is** -- Brief description
2. **When to use it** -- The situation where this works
3. **How to do it** -- Step by step
4. **Why it works** -- What makes this effective

Keep it practical. Real examples are better than theory.

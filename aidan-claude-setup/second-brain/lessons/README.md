# Lessons

Things that went wrong or could have been done better. Claude checks this folder before answering questions, so anything you add here helps it give better advice next time.

## How to Add a Lesson

Create a new .md file with a clear name (e.g., `kart-maintenance-scheduling.md`) and describe:

1. **What happened** -- Brief description of the problem
2. **What went wrong** -- Why it happened
3. **What to do differently** -- The lesson for next time

Keep it short. A few sentences is fine.

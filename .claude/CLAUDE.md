## Reports and Dashboards for Aidan
- Aidan has ADHD. Pages of text won't get read. Every report must be visual first.
- Charts, graphs, colour coding, traffic light indicators (red/amber/green).
- Google Sheets dashboards: conditional formatting + embedded charts, not just rows of numbers.
- Lead with visual overview, detail underneath.
- Google Looker Studio for multi-source dashboards.

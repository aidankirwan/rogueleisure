I've just had a long conversation with a guy called Aidan Kirwan of Rogue Lesiure Ltd. He's a friend of mine. He's a DJ and he runs a business. Well three businesses. It's a bowling alley, an escape centre and a go-kart track. And he doesn't have any kind of AI and automation in place.

In the above folder I've just included a transcription of the call that I just had with him. He needs some help in making his business more efficient, introducing AI and automation to help him. Also to help him personally, he has ADHD and it causes him some issues.

He's going to send me some more information about his business later. But for the time can you go through the call and analyse the problems he identified and the situation that he has now with the current tech that he's using and make a few suggestions on what could be done?

Once I get the other information from him, I'll give that to you and we may need to do some re-look at it too. But just for some initial ideas if you can just look at it and give me some initial ideas to work on. 
Please feel free to ask any clarifying questions 

---

## Assistant Response

I'll read through the call transcription to understand Aidan's situation and identify the key problems and opportunities.

---

## Assistant Response

This is a great discovery call. Let me write up my initial analysis and recommendations. I'll create a plan document that outlines what I've found and some actionable suggestions.

## Assistant Response

I've gone through the call transcript and put together an initial analysis. Here's what stands out:

## The Big Picture

Aidan's running a tight ship - £80k/month to break even with three different activities and 29 staff. The core problems all connect: fragmented systems create manual work, which creates admin burden, which is particularly hard for someone with ADHD.

## Six Key Problems I Identified

1. **Three separate booking systems** - No unified view, can't see total demand
2. **Manual roster creation** - 4-5 hours weekly, contacting staff individually
3. **Paper checklists everywhere** - Fire alarms, temperatures, maintenance logs
4. **Microsoft 365 not properly set up** - Has email but no central file storage
5. **Calendar fragmentation** - DJ, business, and family calendars all separate
6. **ADHD organisational challenges** - Self-described "20 radio stations" in his head

## Quick Wins That Could Demonstrate Value

- **Digital checklists on tablets** - Immediate compliance improvement, manager alerts when things get missed
- **Staff availability form** - Zero-hour staff submit availability weekly instead of being called individually
- **Calendar consolidation** - Single view of all his commitments

## Questions I Have

Before finalising recommendations, a few things would help:

---

## Assistant Response

Good, that makes sense. The hybrid approach is sensible - help him genuinely, and if it works well, it could become a proper engagement and case study for your portfolio.

Given that framing, I'd suggest:

## Recommended Approach

**Start with one or two quick wins** that show tangible value quickly:
- The **digital checklists** are probably the easiest first project - low technical complexity, immediate visible benefit, and it solves a real compliance risk
- The **staff scheduling problem** (4-5 hours weekly) has the clearest ROI argument if you need to pitch to his directors

**The booking system consolidation** is foundational but depends heavily on whether those three systems have APIs. That's something to investigate during the site visit.

**The ADHD support tools** are personal to Aidan rather than business-critical, but could genuinely transform his daily experience. Might be worth separating from the business work.

## What I'd Recommend for Now

1. Keep this initial analysis handy for when you visit
2. When the additional info arrives, I can dig deeper into the specifics
3. The site visit will reveal which systems have integration potential

Is there anything specific in the analysis you'd like me to expand on, or shall I refine the plan once Aidan sends through the additional information?

---

## User Message 8

Yeah there's some good ideas that you've created in the plan. Two of the things that crossed my mind:
1. I think it would be a good idea for Aidan to use something like Wispr Flow. I rarely type anything on my keyboard; I use Wispr Flow. It makes things so much easier and I think because of the way Aidan's brain works and because he's getting so many different calls and things to do, if he uses Wispr Flow together with Granola to take notes from calls and meetings and so on, and then link them, it would be really useful.
2. I think it will be really one of the first steps to install Claude Code and then I would install Claude Code for him, set up loads of things, set up a file structure on his computer with different things in different folders, and then get Claude Code to work on some of those folders. And then installing or buying subscribing to both Wispr Flow and to Granola which are quite affordable. And then having Claude on his computer, I think using Claude Code might be difficult for him but using Claude Code-work I could teach him and his office staff how to use that.
So and I think using that as a base to then help with some of the things that you've mentioned in your plan and you talked about how Air Table could be in the low thousands. I disagree because Claude Code can create a prompt to use in Air Table. The AI within Air Table is called Omni and then that can create a lot of the tables. I could do the little bits and pieces to finish up and finish off the base and the tables that are created, so it wouldn't necessarily cost low thousands. It could be done at a much lower price than that. So I would think about some of the things I just said and then modify a plan based on what I just mentioned.

---

## Assistant Response

You're right on all counts. Let me revise the plan with your approach.

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Edit - /Users/anthonywinyard/.claude/plans/playful-zooming-shore.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

I've restructured the plan based on your input. The key changes:

**Foundation first approach:**
- Wispr Flow + Granola + Claude as the starting point (not an afterthought)
- This addresses Aidan's ADHD directly - capture before organisation
- You install Claude Code for your own access, but teach him and staff to use Claude's web interface

**Dramatically lower costs:**
- Removed the "low thousands" estimates
- Total monthly cost around £56 for the subscription tools
- Airtable's Omni AI generates the base structure from prompts
- You refine rather than build from scratch

**Practical sequencing:**
1. Personal productivity stack (Wispr Flow, Granola, Claude)
2. File structure on his computer
3. Business systems built with AI assistance (scheduling, compliance)
4. Calendar consolidation and task integration

The site visit objectives are now clearer too - assess what's possible with the booking systems, document the paper processes, and potentially start the foundation setup if there's time.

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust before we wait for the additional info from Aidan?

---

## User Message 13

It's a very good plan. One adjustment to the plan: he doesn't use a Mac he uses Windows. So I've just checked and Wispr Flow is available on Windows. I don't know if it's as efficient on Windows as it is on a Mac. I'm presuming that Granola would work on Windows and obviously Airtable and Claude do. Does it make any difference to any of the things you suggested that they are using Windows and not a Mac? I presume it won't make any but I just want to check 

---

## Assistant Response

Good catch on the Windows detail. Let me update the plan.

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Edit - /Users/anthonywinyard/.claude/plans/playful-zooming-shore.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

To answer your question: no, Windows vs Mac makes no meaningful difference to this plan.

- **Wispr Flow** - Available on Windows, should work the same
- **Granola** - Yes, works on Windows (it's cross-platform)
- **Claude** - Web-based, doesn't matter
- **Airtable** - Web-based, doesn't matter
- **Claude Code** - Works on Windows (if you end up installing it for remote access)

The only consideration is that Windows voice-to-text apps sometimes need a moment to check microphone permissions and default audio settings, but that's a one-time setup thing.

Everything else in the plan stands as-is. Ready to finalise?

---

## Assistant Response

The plan is approved and saved. 

The document is now at `/Users/anthonywinyard/GitHub/winyard-ai-website/clients/rogue-leisure/` alongside the original transcript, and there's a copy in your Claude plans folder.

**Summary of what we've got:**

1. **Foundation first** - Wispr Flow + Granola + Claude to address Aidan's ADHD capture problem
2. **Business systems** - Staff scheduling and compliance checklists via Airtable (using Omni AI to build quickly)
3. **Total cost** - Around £56/month for subscriptions, plus your setup time
4. **Key unknowns** - Booking system APIs, Microsoft licensing, tablet availability

When Aidan sends through the additional info (website, Facebook, operational documents), bring it back and we can dig deeper into specifics. The site visit will also reveal what's actually possible with those three booking systems.

Anything else you need before the additional info arrives?

## User Message 16

here is the website address https://www.rogueleisure.co.uk/
In the same folder that I put the other file, I have put two more files which are deep research reports on this business using ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Please analyse those and also take a look at the website. I may also make some comments to him about how the website could be improved. Could be improved. How they could maybe gain more customers.

Look at the website from a few different angles: how is it built? What tech stack have they used to build it? For example is it WordPress or is it React JS? And therefore how easy would it be to add to it to change it?

He mentioned that he was working with a company and I don't think he said he didn't like working with them or they were too expensive. I forget what it was he said but how might the website be improved to help the business increase customers? What does the website lack? Is the content good? Are the images good?

Just find out what is lacking in the website and as I said analyse the two documents in the folder as well. 

---

## Assistant Response

I'll analyse the website and the two research documents. Let me start by reading the documents and exploring the website.

---

## Assistant Response

Excellent, I've got all three sources now. Let me fetch a few more pages from the website to get a fuller picture of their content and structure.

---

## Assistant Response

Now let me update the plan document with a comprehensive website analysis and the insights from the research reports.

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Edit - /Users/anthonywinyard/.claude/plans/playful-zooming-shore.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

I've completed a comprehensive analysis. Here's what I found:

## Website Technical Stack

**Built on Webflow** - a visual website builder. This is actually decent news because:
- Changes can be made without coding
- It's not locked into an expensive custom system
- If Aidan has login access, he (or you) could make updates directly

Worth finding out: **Does Aidan have Webflow access himself, or is an agency controlling it?**

## Key Website Problems

### Critical Gaps

1. **No customer reviews on the site** - Yet the research reports show they have 4.5+ star ratings. This social proof is completely missing.

2. **No photos of actual facilities** - The dual-level track with banked corner is their biggest karting USP, but there are no photos of it. Same with bowling lanes.

3. **Escape room page is thin** - No pricing, no capacity, no duration shown. Customers have to click through to an external booking system to get basic info.

4. **No FAQ section** - Common questions unanswered, creates phone calls.

### What's Working
- Clear navigation
- Pricing visible on bowling/karting pages
- Multiple "Book Now" buttons
- Decent copy tone

## Business Intelligence (from the Research Reports)

### Strengths
- Strong local positioning ("Aylesbury's only multi-activity venue")
- Staff praised repeatedly in reviews
- Unique karting features (dual-level, banked corner, petrol karts - increasingly rare)
- Competitive pricing vs chains

### Red Flags

1. **Equipment reliability is the #1 customer complaint** - Kart breakdowns, bowling lane issues. This appeared in multiple reviews across both research reports.

2. **Maintenance signals** - Karting operation since 2005 (20 years), bowling since 2014 (11 years). Fumes/ventilation complaints. Some reviews mention "dated/tired".

3. **Food limits revenue** - "Pizza-only" menu means groups don't stay for dinner. Competitors make food a primary draw.

4. **Booking friction** - Rigid credit card policies, £10 admin fee.

### Competitive Position
- TeamSport (Dunstable/Reading) has longer tracks and electric karts, but Rogue's petrol karts are actually a USP for purists
- Hollywood Bowl Milton Keynes is bigger and fancier, but Rogue wins on "local convenience"
- **The reliability issues are what cost them** - when things break, customers go to Milton Keynes next time

## Quick Website Wins

| Fix | Time | Impact |
|-----|------|--------|
| Add testimonials | 2-3 hours | High |
| Add facility photos | Half day | High |
| Complete escape room page | 1-2 hours | Medium |
| Create FAQ section | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| Corporate landing page | 4-6 hours | Medium |

## What You Should Tell Aidan

1. **The website is functional but underperforming** - not broken, just not working hard for him
2. **Social proof is the biggest gap** - his good reviews aren't visible
3. **Equipment reliability is the real reputation risk** - this matters more than website fixes
4. **Find out about Webflow access** - if he has it, many fixes become easy

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Write - /Users/anthonywinyard/GitHub/winyard-ai-website/clients/rogue-leisure/website-analysis-and-recommendations.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

I've created a clean, shareable document at:

`/clients/rogue-leisure/website-analysis-and-recommendations.md`

It's written directly to Aidan (not to you), so you can share it as-is or adapt it. The tone is helpful and practical rather than salesy.

Key points covered:
- The site is built on Webflow (good news - changes are doable)
- Testimonials are the biggest missing element
- No photos of the actual facilities
- Escape room page is too thin
- FAQ and "What to Expect" content would reduce friction
- Corporate page is a revenue opportunity
- Equipment reliability is flagged as the real reputation risk (diplomatically)

The document includes a priority table and clear next steps.

---

## Assistant Response

All done. You now have:

**1. Main plan document** (`/clients/rogue-leisure/ai-and-automation-solutions-for-rogue-leisure.md` updated in the plans folder)
- AI/automation recommendations (Wispr Flow, Granola, Claude, Airtable)
- Business systems approach
- Full website and business intelligence analysis

**2. Shareable website document** (`/clients/rogue-leisure/website-analysis-and-recommendations.md`)
- Clean, client-facing format
- Specific recommendations with time estimates
- Priority table
- Written directly to Aidan

**Key findings:**
- Site is Webflow (manageable without an agency if he has access)
- Missing testimonials is the biggest quick win
- No facility photos despite having genuine USPs
- Equipment reliability is the real reputation risk (from customer reviews)
- Corporate bookings are undertapped
- Escape room is franchise-operated (Know Escape), which explains the integration gaps

Ready for when Aidan sends more info or you do the site visit.

## User Message 29

Are you familiar with Google Notebook LM and their audio feature where you can submit documents and it will create an audio podcast of the content of those documents?

Because of Aidan's ADHD, I wonder if he will be able to read the documents that you've created may not be his preferable way of consuming content. So I'm thinking of creating an audio file in Notebook LM which explains how some of the things that we've created in the plan to implement AI and automation. Why he would want to consider using Granola and Wispr Flow and Claude Code and so on.

Could you create a prompt I can put into Notebook LM to create an audio file that I can send to him which helps him understand the plan?

Then create a specific file which I can use in conjunction with that prompt that is a file that I can give to Notebook LM 

---

## Assistant Response

Yes, I'm familiar with NotebookLM's Audio Overview feature. It creates conversational podcast-style discussions between two AI hosts based on the documents you upload.

This is a smart idea for Aidan. Reading documents requires sustained focus, which is exactly what ADHD makes difficult. Audio he can listen to while driving or doing other tasks is much more accessible.

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Write - /Users/anthonywinyard/GitHub/winyard-ai-website/clients/rogue-leisure/audio-briefing-for-aidan.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

Done. I've created two files:

**1. `notebooklm-prompt.md`** - Instructions and the custom prompt to paste into NotebookLM when generating the audio

**2. `audio-briefing-for-aidan.md`** - The document to upload to NotebookLM

The briefing document is written specifically for audio consumption:
- Conversational tone throughout
- Leads with the ADHD angle (why these tools, why this order)
- Explains each tool with concrete examples (dictating a supplier call, processing a complaint email)
- Keeps the business systems section brief but clear
- Mentions the website stuff only in passing
- Ends on an encouraging note
- Positions you correctly (friend helping friend, not salesperson)

**To use it:**
1. Go to NotebookLM (notebooklm.google.com)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Upload `audio-briefing-for-aidan.md`
4. Click "Generate" on Audio Overview
5. Use "Customise" and paste in the prompt from `notebooklm-prompt.md`
6. Download the audio and send via WhatsApp

The document is around 1,500 words, which should produce an audio file of roughly 8-12 minutes. Long enough to cover the key points, short enough to hold attention.

---

## User Message 32

Please create one more prompt for NotebookLM. You created the document to give to Aidan about improvements that could be made to his website so I want to do the same thing for that. I want to create another audio file so rather than him reading it, it will be an audio file specifically talking about ways that the website could be improved.

So if you could create that prompt and also let me know if the document you've created is sufficient to use within NotebookLM with that prompt or if you think that document should be revised in any way to use with NotebookLM 

---

## Assistant Response

The existing document is well-structured for reading, but it's a bit formal and "report-like" for NotebookLM's conversational audio format. The tables especially won't translate well to audio. Let me create a revised version that's optimised for audio, plus the prompt.

---

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Write - /Users/anthonywinyard/GitHub/winyard-ai-website/clients/rogue-leisure/audio-briefing-website.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

Done. I've created:

**1. `notebooklm-prompt-website.md`** - The custom prompt for NotebookLM

**2. `audio-briefing-website.md`** - A new document optimised for audio

**Why I created a new document rather than using the original:**

The original `website-analysis-and-recommendations.md` has some issues for audio:
- Tables don't work in audio (NotebookLM will stumble over them)
- Formal report structure with headers like "Prepared by" and "Date"
- Bullet-heavy format that reads awkwardly when spoken
- "Effort: 2-3 hours" type lines feel robotic when read aloud

The new document:
- Written in flowing paragraphs that sound natural when spoken
- Uses conversational language throughout
- Removes all tables
- Keeps the same information but presents it as a narrative
- Includes specific examples (the banked corner, Crazy Cat Lady)
- Ends with clear, practical next steps

Both documents contain the same recommendations, just packaged differently. The original is better for reading/reference; the new one is better for audio.

You now have two separate NotebookLM audio files you can create:
1. **AI and automation plan** (the first one we did)
2. **Website improvements** (this one)

Send them separately so Aidan can listen to whichever interests him first, without either being too long.

---

## User Message 36

You mentioned that you created a plan for recommendations to improve the actual business, not the website side of it but for everything else. And I'm sure you said you created a plan but I can't find that plan. Can you remind me where that plan is? 

---

## Assistant Response

The main plan document is at:

**`/Users/anthonywinyard/.claude/plans/playful-zooming-shore.md`**

This contains everything: the AI/automation recommendations (Wispr Flow, Granola, Claude, Airtable), the phased approach, cost summary, and the website/business analysis.

There's also a copy of the original content in the client folder:

**`/Users/anthonywinyard/GitHub/winyard-ai-website/clients/rogue-leisure/ai-and-automation-solutions-for-rogue-leisure.md`**

This was the original file that came from your call transcript, which I then expanded.

So in the client folder you now have:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ai-and-automation-solutions-for-rogue-leisure.md` | Original call notes + summary |
| `comprehensive-intelligence-report...md` | ChatGPT deep research |
| `deep-research-report.md` | Gemini deep research |
| `website-analysis-and-recommendations.md` | Shareable website doc for Aidan |
| `audio-briefing-for-aidan.md` | NotebookLM source for AI/automation audio |
| `audio-briefing-website.md` | NotebookLM source for website audio |
| `notebooklm-prompt.md` | Prompt for AI/automation audio |
| `notebooklm-prompt-website.md` | Prompt for website audio |

The comprehensive plan with all the details is in the `.claude/plans/` folder because that's where Claude Code stores working plans.

Would you like me to copy the full plan into the client folder as a standalone document?

---

## User Message 37

Can you please create a plan which is written especially for Aidan so it's with the intention of Aidan reading it? It should explain the suggestions that have been made and why some of these suggestions have been made and give a time frame 

---

## Assistant Response

I'll create a clean, client-facing plan document written specifically for Aidan.

---

## Assistant Response

*[Tool: Write - /Users/anthonywinyard/GitHub/winyard-ai-website/clients/rogue-leisure/implementation-plan-for-aidan.md]*

---

## Assistant Response

Done. I've created the plan at:

**`/clients/rogue-leisure/implementation-plan-for-aidan.md`**

It's written directly to Aidan with:

- **Why the plan starts where it does** - explaining why personal tools come before business systems (the ADHD context)
- **Each tool explained simply** - what it does, why it matters for him specifically, with concrete examples
- **Clear costs** - monthly breakdown, total under £56
- **Timeline** - Phase 1 on day one, business systems in weeks 2-4
- **What you need from him** - site visit, computer access, Microsoft info
- **Honest tone** - friend helping friend, not consultant selling services

The document is around 1,500 words. Long enough to be comprehensive, short enough to be readable (though he might still prefer the audio version).

You could also put this document into NotebookLM if you want a third audio file that covers the full plan in a more structured way than the first audio briefing.

---

## User Message 39

Are you able to convert that Markdown document into a .doc file? I don't think he uses Markdown so I wanted to give it to him in a more presentable format

---

## Assistant Response

I can't directly create a .doc file, but I can convert the Markdown to a Word document using Pandoc if it's installed on your system. Let me check.

---

## Assistant Response

Pandoc isn't installed. Let me check if there are other options available.

---

## Assistant Response

macOS has `textutil` which can convert to various formats including .docx. Let me try that.

---

## Assistant Response

Done. The Word document has been created at:

**`/clients/rogue-leisure/implementation-plan-for-aidan.docx`**

One caveat: `textutil` does a basic conversion. The formatting will be functional (headings, paragraphs, tables) but it won't be beautifully styled. If you open it in Word, you may want to:
- Apply a nicer heading style
- Adjust the fonts
- Add your Winyard AI logo if you have one

But the content and structure will all be there and readable.

---

## User Message 40 (Added 3 Feb 2026, 22:30)

I got feedback from Aidan; he absolutely loved the audio file which I created in Notebook LM. He said, "Well you really understand me. I don't really like to read; I prefer to listen" and it made me think that although this was ideal for Aidan, I actually think many people would prefer this because of the two-person format on Notebook LM instead of simply just sending someone a proposal or a quote which is all quite dry and they may not understand some of it. The Notebook LM audio file's two hosts actually explain why each of the things is in a proposal and why it matters. They really go into depth and explain it. So I think this is a new thing that I will start to do a lot more from now on because Aidan loved it but I think many prospective clients will like that as well.

---

## Key Insight: NotebookLM Audio for Client Proposals

**Discovery**: Using Google NotebookLM to create audio briefings for clients is significantly more effective than written proposals alone.

**Why it works**:
- Two-host conversational format explains the "why" behind recommendations
- Accessible for people who don't like reading (ADHD, busy, etc.)
- Can listen while driving, walking, doing other tasks
- Hosts naturally elaborate on points that might be skipped when reading
- Feels more personal than a document

**Implementation**: Create a simplified document optimised for audio (no tables, conversational tone) plus a custom prompt for NotebookLM, then generate the audio overview.

**Future use**: Consider doing this for all significant client proposals as standard practice.

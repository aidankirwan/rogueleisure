## Why This Plan Exists

After our conversation, I put together some ideas for how AI and automation could help you and Rogue Leisure. This isn't a sales pitch. It's a friend sharing what's possible based on what you told me about the challenges you're facing.

You mentioned a few things that stuck with me:

- The business is tight. £80k a month to break even. No room for expensive experiments.
- You've got three separate booking systems that don't talk to each other.
- One of your team spends 4-5 hours every week just building the roster.
- Paper checklists everywhere for compliance and maintenance.
- Your ADHD means you know what needs doing, but getting it done is a different story. "20 radio stations going at once."

This plan addresses all of that. But it starts in a place you might not expect.

## The Core Idea: Capture First, Systems Second

Most people would look at your situation and say "let's build you a scheduling system" or "let's digitise those checklists." Those things matter, and we'll get to them. But they're not the starting point.

The starting point is you.

With ADHD, your brain generates ideas constantly. Tasks pile up. Conversations happen and the action items disappear into the ether. By the end of the day, you're mentally exhausted, not because you're lazy, but because your brain has been working overtime just trying to hold everything together.

The solution isn't "try harder to be organised." The solution is giving your brain tools that capture things automatically, so you don't have to rely on memory and willpower.

That's why this plan starts with personal productivity tools before business systems.

---

## Phase 1: Your Personal Productivity Stack

**Timeline:** Can be set up in a single visit (1-2 hours)

### Wispr Flow (Voice-to-Text)

**What it does:** Lets you speak instead of type, anywhere on your computer. Emails, notes, documents, messages. You talk, the words appear.

**Why this matters for you:** Your brain moves fast. Typing is slow and requires you to focus on the mechanical act of getting words onto a screen. Speaking is natural. You can capture a thought the moment it occurs.

**Example:** You get a call about a supplier delay. Instead of scribbling a note that gets lost, you open a document and speak: "Call from Dave at Parts Direct. Brake pads delayed until Thursday. Need to reschedule the maintenance slot." Done. Captured. No friction.

**Cost:** Around £10/month

---

### Granola (AI Meeting Notes)

**What it does:** Automatically transcribes and summarises your calls and meetings. Captures what was discussed, what decisions were made, and what needs to happen next.

**Why this matters for you:** Meetings are exhausting when you're trying to listen, engage, remember, and plan all at once. With Granola, you can just be present. The AI handles the capture.

**Example:** You have a call with your accountant. Afterwards, Granola gives you a summary: "Discussed cash flow for March. Agreed to delay lane maintenance until April. Action: Send updated revenue forecast by Friday." No more "what did we actually decide?" moments.

**Cost:** Around £10/month

---

### Claude (AI Assistant)

**What it does:** An AI assistant that helps with emails, documents, planning, and thinking through problems. Available 24/7.

**Why this matters for you:** Sometimes the hardest part of a task is starting. Claude can help break things down, draft a first version, or be a sounding board when you're stuck.

**Example:** You need to respond to a complaint email but don't know where to start. You paste it into Claude and say: "Help me write a professional but friendly response. The customer is upset about a kart breakdown during their son's party." Claude drafts something. You tweak it. Done in two minutes instead of twenty.

**Cost:** Around £18/month for Claude Pro

---

### Why These Three Together

The magic is in how they connect:

1. **Wispr Flow** captures thoughts and tasks as they happen
2. **Granola** captures meetings and calls automatically
3. **Claude** helps process everything and turn it into action

**Total cost:** Around £38/month. Less than one bowling party brings in.

I'll install these on your computer and show you how to use them. You don't need to configure anything.

---

## Phase 2: File Structure and Organisation

**Timeline:** Done during the same visit as Phase 1

Before building any business systems, I'll set up a proper folder structure on your computer. Separate folders for Bowling, Karting, Escape Room, Staff, Compliance, Finance.

This sounds basic, but it matters. When you capture a note about kart maintenance using Wispr Flow, there needs to be an obvious place to put it. Good organisation reduces decisions, and decisions drain mental energy.

---

## Phase 3: Business Systems

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks after foundation is in place

Once your personal capture tools are working, we can tackle the business problems. I'll build these using Airtable, a flexible database tool that doesn't require coding.

### Staff Scheduling System

**The problem you described:** One of your team spends 4-5 hours every week building the roster. She has to check bookings across three different systems, then contact zero-hour staff individually to check availability.

**What I'd build:**
- A simple form where staff submit their availability each week
- A system that pulls booking data from your three systems (depending on what's technically possible)
- Suggested rosters based on availability and expected demand
- Notifications to staff about their shifts

**Time saved:** 3-4 hours per week. That's over 150 hours per year.

**Cost:** Airtable subscription (~£18/month) plus my setup time.

---

### Digital Compliance Checklists

**The problem you described:** Paper checklists everywhere. Fire alarm tests, kitchen temperatures, kart maintenance logs, tyre records. If someone forgets a check, nobody knows until there's a problem.

**What I'd build:**
- Tablet-based checklists for each area
- Everything timestamped and logged automatically
- Manager alerts when mandatory checks are missed
- Searchable records for insurance and compliance

**Why this matters:** When an inspector asks for maintenance records, you can pull them up in seconds instead of digging through filing cabinets.

**Cost:** Minimal if using the same Airtable subscription. You may need tablets if you don't have them already.

---

### Booking Dashboard

**The problem you described:** Three separate booking systems (Cubicle for bowling, bespoke for karting, Resolver for escape room). Nobody can see total demand across all activities without checking three different places.

**What I'd build:** A simple dashboard showing upcoming bookings from all three systems in one view.

**Important note:** This depends on whether your booking systems have ways to export data or connect to other software. I'll need to investigate this during my visit. If the systems are locked down, this becomes more complicated.

---

## Phase 4: Calendar Consolidation

**Timeline:** After Phase 1 is working well

You mentioned having three separate calendars: Google (DJ work), Outlook (business), and a family diary. That's a lot of mental overhead.

Once the capture tools are working, we can look at consolidating everything into a single view. Probably Google Calendar as the hub, with the others syncing into it. One place to see everything.

---

## What This Costs

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Wispr Flow | £10 |
| Granola | £10 |
| Claude Pro | £18 |
| Airtable | £18 |
| **Total** | **£56/month** |

That's under £700 per year. The scheduling system alone saves enough staff hours to pay for it many times over.

My time to set this up is separate, but because I'm using AI tools to build the systems, the cost is much lower than traditional development. We're talking hundreds, not thousands.

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Personal productivity tools (Wispr Flow, Granola, Claude) | Day 1 of site visit |
| **Phase 2** | File structure and organisation | Day 1 of site visit |
| **Phase 3** | Staff scheduling system | Weeks 2-3 |
| **Phase 3** | Digital compliance checklists | Weeks 3-4 |
| **Phase 3** | Booking dashboard (if technically feasible) | Week 4+ |
| **Phase 4** | Calendar consolidation | Once Phase 1 is working |

## What I Need From You

1. **A visit to the venue** - I need to see the systems in person, understand how things actually work day-to-day, and check what's technically possible with your booking systems.

2. **Access to your computer** - To install the productivity tools and set up the file structure.

3. **Information about your Microsoft setup** - You mentioned having Exchange email but no SharePoint. I'd like to check what's included in your plan, as you might already be paying for tools you're not using.

4. **Patience with new habits** - The tools only work if you use them. Voice-to-text feels weird at first. Give it a week before deciding if it's for you.

---

## A Note About the Website

I also looked at your website and found some opportunities there (missing testimonials, no photos of the track, thin escape room page). I've written that up separately. But the personal productivity tools come first. Website improvements can wait until you have the mental bandwidth to think about them.

---

## Why This Approach

I could have started with the flashy stuff: booking dashboards, automated systems, integrations. But that would be solving the wrong problem first.

The real bottleneck isn't your business systems. It's the cognitive load you're carrying every day. Fix that first, and everything else becomes easier.

These tools don't change who you are or how your brain works. They just give that brain the support system it needs to work the way it naturally wants to.

Voice instead of typing. Automatic capture instead of manual notes. AI assistance instead of staring at a blank screen.

Small changes. Big relief.

---

## Next Steps

1. Let me know if this makes sense and if you want to proceed
2. We'll find a time for me to visit the venue
3. I'll bring lunch (you offered, but I'm buying)

Looking forward to it.

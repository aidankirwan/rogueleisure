**Date:** 7 February 2026

## ROLLER's Karting Module

ROLLER has a dedicated karting module with:
- Session-based booking with capacity management
- Timing system integration (compatible with various timing providers)
- Driver management and weight/height restrictions
- Waiver management for each session
- Multi-session packages

**Key question for demo:** Does ROLLER's karting module integrate with Rogue's existing timing hardware, or would that need replacing too?

## Clubspeed Alternative

**Clubspeed** (acquired Resova in 2022) is another option worth noting:
- FEC-specific platform (originally karting, now multi-activity)
- Since they own Resova, there may be a natural migration path for escape room data
- Worth requesting a demo alongside ROLLER for comparison
- More established in the karting space specifically

---

## Recommendation

Request a ROLLER demo before Tuesday's on-site visit if possible. The case for evaluation is strong:
- Cost-neutral or cheaper than current three-system setup
- Solves the fragmented booking UX problem
- Includes CRM (addresses the no-contact-database gap)
- Built-in reporting eliminates manual Excel bookkeeping
- Multi-activity packages capture upsell revenue currently lost

Even if ROLLER isn't adopted immediately, having the demo data strengthens the implementation plan and gives Aidan a concrete comparison point.

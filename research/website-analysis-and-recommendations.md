**Prepared by:** Tony Winyard, Winyard AI

## Overview

This analysis covers the Rogue Leisure website (rogueleisure.co.uk) and identifies opportunities to improve conversions, customer experience, and search visibility.

---

## Technical Summary

**Platform:** Webflow (visual website builder)

**What this means for you:**
- Changes can be made without coding knowledge
- If you have Webflow login access, you can update content yourself
- If an agency is managing it, many of these changes are straightforward requests

**Key question:** Do you have direct access to the Webflow editor, or does an agency control all updates?

---

## What's Working Well

- Clear navigation structure
- Pricing visible on bowling and karting pages
- Multiple "Book Now" buttons throughout
- Conversational, engaging copy tone
- Mobile responsive design

---

## What's Missing (Opportunities)

### 1. Customer Reviews and Testimonials

**The problem:** You have strong customer ratings (4.5+ stars on Google and TripAdvisor), but none of this social proof appears on your website.

**Why it matters:** Visitors can't see that other people love the venue. Reviews build trust and reduce booking hesitation.

**The fix:** Add testimonials to the homepage and each activity page. Pull the best quotes from your existing Google/TripAdvisor reviews.

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### 2. Facility Photos

**The problem:** The karting page shows karts but not the actual track. The bowling page lacks images of the lanes. Customers can't visualise what they're booking.

**Why it matters:** Your dual-level track with the banked corner is a genuine USP - it's what makes you different from competitors. But visitors can't see it.

**The fix:** Add photos showing:
- The track layout (especially the dual-level section and banked corner)
- Bowling lanes interior
- Party rooms
- The arcade area

**Effort:** Half day to photograph, 1-2 hours to upload

---

### 3. Escape Room Page

**The problem:** The "Crazy Cat Lady" page is thin. No pricing shown, no capacity information, no duration, no difficulty rating. Customers have to click through to an external booking system to get basic information.

**Why it matters:** Friction loses bookings. If someone can't quickly see whether the room fits their group size and budget, they'll leave.

**The fix:** Add to the page:
- Price per person
- Group size (2-10 players)
- Duration (60 minutes)
- Difficulty rating (3/5)
- Age recommendations

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

---

### 4. FAQ Section

**The problem:** Common questions aren't answered on the website. What should I wear for karting? Where do I park? What's the cancellation policy? What are the age/height requirements?

**Why it matters:** Unanswered questions create phone calls (staff time) or lost bookings (customer gives up).

**The fix:** Create a dedicated FAQ page, or add FAQ sections to each activity page. Cover:
- Dress code / what to wear
- Parking (free on-site)
- Arrival time requirements (especially the 45-minute early arrival for karting)
- Cancellation and rescheduling policy
- Age and height requirements
- Accessibility information

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### 5. "What to Expect" Content

**The problem:** First-time visitors don't know the experience flow, especially for karting. The 45-minute early arrival requirement is easy to miss.

**Why it matters:** Unclear expectations lead to no-shows, late arrivals, and frustrated customers.

**The fix:** Add a "What to Expect" section to each activity page. Walk customers through the experience from arrival to finish.

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### 6. Corporate / Group Landing Page

**The problem:** Your corporate offering is buried. There's no dedicated page that speaks directly to someone organising a work event.

**Why it matters:** Corporate bookings are high-value. Companies searching for "team building Aylesbury" or "corporate events Buckinghamshire" should find a page that speaks to their needs.

**The fix:** Create a dedicated corporate page with:
- Package options and pricing
- Capacity information
- What makes you suitable for corporate groups
- Enquiry form for quotes
- Testimonials from previous corporate clients

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

## SEO Opportunities

### Current Weaknesses
- Limited meta descriptions on pages
- No schema markup for local business, events, or reviews
- Thin content on some pages (escape room especially)
- No blog or content marketing

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Add local business schema markup** - Helps Google understand your business and display rich results (opening hours, reviews, location).

2. **Optimise page titles and meta descriptions** - Each page should have a unique, keyword-rich description.

3. **Create landing pages for key searches:**
   - "Karting Aylesbury"
   - "Bowling parties Aylesbury"
   - "Corporate events Aylesbury"
   - "Indoor activities Buckinghamshire"

4. **Consider a blog** (longer term) - Articles like "Best birthday party ideas in Aylesbury" or "Karting tips for beginners" can attract local search traffic.

## One Important Note

The website improvements above will help convert more visitors into bookings. However, based on customer feedback analysis, **equipment reliability is your biggest reputation risk**.

Multiple customer reviews mention kart breakdowns and bowling lane issues. When things go wrong, customers compare you unfavourably to Milton Keynes options and don't return.

Website improvements attract customers. Reliability keeps them.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Check Webflow access** - Can you log in to the Webflow editor directly?
2. **Gather photos** - Either take new ones or collect existing images of facilities
3. **Collect testimonials** - Screenshot or copy the best Google/TripAdvisor reviews
4. **Decide on priorities** - Which improvements matter most to you right now?

Happy to discuss any of these recommendations in more detail.
